When he died in 1997 from HIV, a disease that carried huge stigma in Africa, there was fear his legacy would die with him, but this film shows that the impact of his life and music is still felt today</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Artistic gymnast Zion has been flying high, qualifying for the British Championships and securing a place in the national squad. However, at a recent competition, Zion had an awkward landing and has started feeling pain in his lower back. His physio has suggested he has an MRI scan to work out the cause of the pain and see what can be done to fix it. Club-mate Winston has been asked to represent his club in the British Club Championships, where the best of the gym clubs battle it out to find out which is the best club in the country. Not only does he have the pressure of representing his club, but he will be teammates with gymnastic superstars that include two of his heroes: Olympian and World champion Joe Fraser and Commonwealth Gold winner Dom Cunningham. Back in the gym, Alice is working with some of the younger gymnasts, demonstrating how to do the perfect teddy bear roll.</desc>

She also adds some canned tuna, green olives, and boiled egg. She seasons the mixture with paprika, black pepper and her special ingredient, oregano. Then Lola spreads the filling over the dough, which has been in the oven. She finishes the recipe by adding the last piece of dough on top and then putting it back in the oven to cook. Will Lola's friends find the empanadas tasty? Will they guess her special ingredient? There's a very exciting Spanish surprise waiting for her friends while they enjoy their meal!</desc>

Inside Nigel’s bag are a toy pig, a toy sheep and a toy chicken, and all the parents and babies have different objects and toys that are themed around things you might find at a farm. These are explored through discovery, play, song and story. Grown-ups at home are encouraged to take part by hiding safe, baby-appropriate farm objects and toys inside a fabric bag or pillowcase for them to reveal and explore with their baby! The fun song Old MacDonald Had A Farm features, as does a story involving Baby Bear, and viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring farm things too. The Together Song gets everyone moving about before some calm time with sensory scarves and the Goodbye Song.</desc>
