Over the course of a year, we discover what it is like to live as part of a close family and community in a tiny traditional Cornish coastal village. We see how Jamie’s life is impacted by the ebb and flow of the seasons as the tourists come and go, and the winter storms roll in stopping the boats from heading out. He continues to learn the family business and explore what the future might hold for the next generation of Cornish fishermen. Will Jamie keep his heart set on the sea and a life as one of the sons of Cadgwith Cove?</desc>

      <desc lang="en">In this episode we follow Memphis as he learns all about the internationally celebrated St Patrick's Day. During a game of football in the garden, Memphis talks with his family about what they can do to celebrate this special day. After discovering that St Patrick was a shepherd on Slemish mountain, Memphis and his dad decide to visit a sheep farm. They learn first-hand from a real shepherd how to herd the wooly animals. It's a long way to the top of the huge Slemish mountain, but once they get to the top, Memphis and the family take time to enjoy a yummy picnic. Before planting a shamrock, Memphis learns all about why they are so special to the people of Ireland. Next, it's off to Granny's house, where it's time to make traditional shortbread for their tea party. Then mum needs some help decorating the house with banners, balloons and bunting.

Kika knows the way like the back of her paw, but there are some important things they must do along the way. Kika has to help Dr Amit navigate a pelican crossing, using a top secret cone to cross the road safely. Then she must guide him through the station and up the escalator to the platform. There are some hazards to avoid, including a tumbling box full of Kika’s favourite snacks - carrots! Then, at the station, their mission is almost derailed by a last-minute platform change.

      <desc lang="en">Manchester City v Burnley (Kick-off 5.45pm). All the action from the sixth-round tie at Etihad Stadium. Burnley are managed by former City captain Vincent Kompany, who won this trophy twice while at the club.

However, they face the toughest of tests against the cup favourites, who tend to be particularly ruthless against lower league opposition, as shown in their 3-0 win away to Bristol City in the previous round. With analysis from Alan Shearer and Micah Richards</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Tim lands himself a role as an extra in a period biopic about a famous disabled musician. When some campaigners kick up a fuss about the star lead - James Norton - not being disabled, Tim is recast as the lead in a knee-jerk reaction to avoid media backlash. The bosses are so concerned with optics surrounding disability, they completely disregard the authenticity of the film - Tim doesn't even have the right disability and aside from that, cannot act to save his life. Chaos therefore ensues as he brings the production to its knees. Tim Renkow stars in this comedy a cerebral palsy sufferer who uses his condition to get away with saying what others are unable to</desc>
