And what is going on behind the net curtains of parish magazine editor Horace Greeley, whose twin sisters Heidi and Laurel seem to be hiding a mysterious secret?

His physio has suggested he has an MRI scan to work out the cause of the pain and see what can be done to fix it. Club-mate Winston has been asked to represent his club in the British Club Championships, where the best of the gym clubs battle it out to find out which is the best club in the country. Not only does he have the pressure of representing his club, but he will be teammates with gymnastic superstars that include two of his heroes: Olympian and World champion Joe Fraser and Commonwealth Gold winner Dom Cunningham.

Even though his team are there to support him, he has to face his fear and take on the pommel, the apparatus that has caused him more than his fair share of problems during the last season. The boys also face the distraction of a trip to an out-of-this-world car museum - but will Winston be able to hold it together when the team comes up against some of the world’s best gymnasts from the USA and France. Back in Birmingham, the display girls get to grips with a new routine in preparation for a performance in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games. Coach Lisa has given the girls a new challenge – not only do they have to perfect their routine, but they also have to choreograph part of it themselves.</desc>

The boys are surprised to find an old sheet with a funny picture of a skeleton on it. What could it mean? And who does it belong to? It’s off to the Museum of Cornish Treasures to see if Suzy and Archie have any clues. They reckon it’s something to do with ships and send Fred and Pete off to Charlestown Harbour. There they spot a large ship but are collared by the ship’s captain as they climb on board – not any old ship’s captain, but a pirate captain! Fred and Pete are thrilled to learn that their sheet is, in fact, a pirate flag - a Jolly Roger, used by pirates to warn other ships that they’re on their way to take their goods. After dressing up as pirates, Suzy sends them off to Shipwreck Treasure Museum where museum curator Daniel explains all about pirate treasure like gold and silver coins.

In Somalia, they have the traditional dish of nafaqo, which is boiled egg wrapped in mashed potato. This is what Zahra-Rose has chosen to make for her friends. To begin with, Zahra-Rose seasons mashed potato with salt, black pepper, flour, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder and fresh coriander. She then wraps the potato mixture around her special ingredient, hard-boiled eggs, rolls them in breadcrumbs and puts them in the oven to be cooked. Zahra-Rose also serves a fresh chilli sauce, so her friends can use it for dipping. Not only does Zahra-Rose have beautiful decorations, she also has a surprise picnic planned. Will her friends realise what her special ingredient is?</desc>

Elder Chick demonstrates the Fluffytown nap timer and explains when she presses the button it's time to snooze, and when the hand reaches the balloon, it's time for the Siesta Fiesta. She starts the timer, and everyone hurries off to their nap stations to begin their naps. As the other Fluffytowners start to doze off, Love Monster struggles to fall asleep. After trying a pre-nap workout with Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny, practising yoga with Book Cub and pillow drumming with Bad Idea Puppy, a frustrated Love Monster gives up and thinks he might as well start getting ready for the party. He heads over to his decks and puts on a song just before the sleep timer goes off, and everyone awakes full of energy. As everyone boogies to the beats, Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny looks over to the decks, but Love Monster is nowhere to be seen. She </desc>

      <desc lang="en">Once dubbed the 'murder capital' of the world, for nearly three decades, rival gangs ruled the streets of El Salvador through a regime of violence, extortion and fear. That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Once dubbed the 'murder capital' of the world, for nearly three decades, rival gangs ruled the streets of El Salvador through a regime of violence, extortion and fear. That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Once dubbed the 'murder capital' of the world, for nearly three decades, rival gangs ruled the streets of El Salvador through a regime of violence, extortion and fear. That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>
