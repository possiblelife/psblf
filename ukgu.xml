      <desc lang="en">The Lemmings open a nightclub with blasting music and a disco ball in an igloo they have built not far from the cabin. The noise prevents Grizzy from sleeping. The bear confiscates the disco ball and propels the Lemmings far into the distance. They land in an ice cave where they discover a console that lights up the stars in the sky and controls the northern lights. The canopy of heaven starts blinking. The Lemmings transform the ice field into an open-air discotheque!</desc>

And Chantelle joins Aneeshwar, who is a keen bird watcher - together they try to spot a puffling, a baby puffin, in the cliffs. Chantelle and Rory’s fact files help answer all of Emily’s questions. With the help of the special poem, we discover that like lots of other teeny tiny creatures, puffins are superheroes, helping our planet in their own special way.

      <desc lang="en">Two teams touch down at the STARS space station to take on three scientific challenges to win out-of-this world prizes. First, they must decide whether objects will float or sink in a water tank. Then, in a game based on light and shadows, the young scientists have to figure out what their team captains are holding by observing their shadows behind a huge screen. Finally, the teams learn about structures by building arched bridges they can step across to reach an island. Meanwhile, Sam and Ayo are competing to see who can make the best model rocket. The scientist who loses must clean the other’s dirty lab beakers for a week! Who will triumph?</desc>

      <desc lang="en">When a strange, lumpy, green ball rolls to their feet, Fred and Pete are sure they've found treasure. But what is it? At the Museum of Cornish Treasures, Archie tells them that their treasure grew up in Cornwall under a big dome, and Suzy sends them to the Eden Project to find out more. Here, they meet Catherine who says their treasure is a type of fruit from a place far away. But how did the fruit get to Cornwall? Suzy buzzes on the Treasure Comm and suggests Fred and Pete take a trip on a zip wire and explore the tropical dome. They meet Catherine again who reveals their treasure is a screw pine fruit. This fruit is usually found in hot countries in Asia and Africa but is able to grow in Eden’s dome because it's so warm inside. Catherine takes Fred and Pete on a plant hunt around the tropical dome. Catherine explains how fruits produce seeds which then grow into new trees that produce fruits themselves</desc>

We’ll see how plants in hot, dry parts of world like the desert thrive in their own special ways, like the cactus plant that stores litres of water in its waxy leaves.

Archie tells them the treasure might be helpful to a seal and Suzy sends them to meet her seal expert friend, Lizzi. Lizzi explains that seals are often spotted along the Cornish coast, but they're also in danger of getting tangled up in beach rubbish. Suzy rings in on the Treasure Comm and sends Fred and Pete off to the Cornish Seal Sanctuary at Gweek to discover more.

Rory and Sandy head deep into the forest to try and find some red squirrels, whilst Chantelle heads offshore to an island to meet a local expert who has been studying them in the wild. Chantelle and Rory’s fact files help answer all of Alistair’s questions. With the help of the Teeny Tiny Creatures poem, we discover that, like lots of other teeny tiny creatures, red squirrels are superheroes and help our planet in their own special way. In the Teeny Tiny Task, Rory shows Sandy what it might feel like to be a red squirrel as he jumps around in the treetops.</desc>
