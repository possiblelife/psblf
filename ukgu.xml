      <desc lang="en">Gabriel Weston explores the forensic advances that have elevated murder weapons from mere instruments to crucial pieces of evidence. She sees how arsenic, the undetectable weapon of choice in the 19th century, was exposed as the killer thanks to one simple chemical test, and finds out how distinctive marks on a victim's skull led to the weapon and, in turn, the killer. Gabriel also looks at the latest forensic developments, from 3-D laser scanning that can reconstruct the sequence of events at the scene of a gun crime to the pioneering chemistry able to determine where in the world someone has been based on just a few strands of their hair</desc>

At the Museum of Cornish Treasures, Archie tells them that their treasure grew up in Cornwall under a big dome, and Suzy sends them to the Eden Project to find out more. Here, they meet Catherine who says their treasure is a type of fruit from a place far away. But how did the fruit get to Cornwall? Suzy buzzes on the Treasure Comm and suggests Fred and Pete take a trip on a zip wire and explore the tropical dome. They meet Catherine again who reveals their treasure is a screw pine fruit. This fruit is usually found in hot countries in Asia and Africa but is able to grow in Eden’s dome because it's so warm inside. Catherine takes Fred and Pete on a plant hunt around the tropical dome. Catherine explains how fruits produce seeds which then grow into new trees that produce fruits themselves</desc>

These are explored through discovery, play, song and story. Grown-ups at home are encouraged to take part by hiding a safe, baby appropriate red toy or object inside a fabric bag or pillowcase for them to reveal and explore with their baby! The popular baby song Little Robin Redbreast features, as does a story involving Baby Bear and Baby Tiger, and viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring red things too.

Archie reveals that this object will ‘keep you safe and sound’, while Suzy finds a photo of a friend of hers with a big metal object just like the one Fred and Pete found. She sends them back to the beach to meet him. Fred and Pete arrive on the beach and are startled to see what looks like an alien with a metal object just like theirs, walking up to them. The ‘alien’ is actually Suzy's friend Iain, and he explains that the metal object on his head is a helmet for a very old-fashioned deep sea diving suit. Fred and Pete then wonder what divers do when they’re underwater. Suzy sends them to the other end of the beach to meet Hannah from the Cornish Diving Centre, who tells them about modern diving equipment and how they use it. Hannah invites Fred</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Once dubbed the 'murder capital' of the world, for nearly three decades, rival gangs ruled the streets of El Salvador through a regime of violence, extortion and fear. That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Once dubbed the 'murder capital' of the world, for nearly three decades, rival gangs ruled the streets of El Salvador through a regime of violence, extortion and fear. That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Marking the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the HMT Empire Windrush to British shores in 1948, cameras follow a project spearheaded by King Charles. He commissioned 10 leading artists, from Britain and abroad, to create portraits of 10 pioneering members of the Windrush Generation. The sitters, many in their nineties, speak frankly about their experiences of arriving in Britain, making lives for themselves, and the contribution they have made to their communities and the nation</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Zeinab Badawi meets Sir Bryn Terfel, one of the most distinguished singers of our age. A star who is in demand on stages across the world, Bryn has stayed true to his Welsh roots and is a great proponent for Welsh culture. He invites Zeinab behind the scenes not only at the Royal Opera House where he is a regular performer, but also in his native Wales where he still lives and where he is recording an album of traditional folk songs. He was chosen personally by King Charles to sing at his coronation. Zeinab visits the Welsh National Opera which launched Bryn's international career and speaks to WNO general director, Aidan Lang who oversaw his debut performance. The WNO's touring wardrobe manager Judith Russell, shows Zeinab Sir Bryn's costume as Falstaff in the opera by Verdi and explains how she was tasked with dressing him for this iconic role.
