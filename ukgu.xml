Grown-ups at home are encouraged to hide a safe, baby-appropriate fluffy toy or object inside a fabric bag or pillowcase, to explore with their baby. Some viewers at home show what fluffy items they’ve been playing with too. The traditional nursery rhyme Mary Had a Little Lamb features, as does a story about Baby Bear exploring different textures.

      <desc lang="en">Animated comedy series. Amber organises a special lunch event in the cafeteria featuring a chicory-based menu to rehabilitate the underrated vegetable - to avoid eating it, Mo tells Amber that he's highly sensitive to chicory.

Sam keeps the crystal in her school locker because she doesn't trust her clumsy half-brother Mo with it, but when Sam loses the crystal after a mishap and it gets stuck inside John-Cedrick's locker, Sam is forced to ask for the power to go through walls so that she can recover the crystal undetected and avoid embarrassment.</desc>
