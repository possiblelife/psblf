The What’s in the Box? game reveals a wooden triangle toy, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are inspired by shapes. This theme is explored through play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate shapes toy or object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about discovering new words, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear look for lots of different shapes at home and when they’re out and about. Viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring the shapes theme too. Plus, The Circle Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with stretching and the Goodbye song.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Tinks is a disability assistance dog for her owner Charli, who has a condition that makes it painful for her to pick things up or to push and pull things. Tinks uses her superfetch skills to help Charli every day. The smallest of the Dog Squad gang, Tinks is a little Lhasa Apso with lots of big dog energy. Charli has been invited to a party but is feeling a bit nervous about going. Tinks loves helping Charli feel confident. She wants to help Charli feel good about herself so she can go and have fun at the party. Tinks fetches Charli’s hair brush so Charli can brush her newly-dyed pink hair, and then helps Charli choose a party outfit. And, when Charli can’t find her keys, Tinks dives into a mountain of clothes on the bed to search for them. Now they’re party ready, but it's raining! Tinks is determined to help Charli get to the party, even in the rain. But how? She summons all her big dog energy and sets off in search of a plan. Just wait until Dog Squad hear about this!</desc>

But soon he has competition in the form of Glitch, who races Foz to find an object that both of their metal detectors pick up - which turns out to be a rusty spoon! In the end, neither of them manage to find any pieces of meteorite, prompting Glitch to send the Grimbots to drag a huge space rock to Earth to help him!

Before he goes, he tells Love Monster that soon it will be time for him to go on to his next kiting challenge. Love Monster looks at all the other kites and sees the dragon kite, which is the largest kite of them all. Love Monster’s small kite doesn’t seem that exciting any more. He decides to try the dragon kite for just a minute. At first it seems easy, but then a wind gets it tangled in a tree. The rope breaks, and the kite flies off, causing mayhem in Fluffytown with everyone thinking it is a real dragon invasion. Finally, Elder Panda arrives and manages to bring it down to the ground using an umbrella, and Love Monster comes clean, saying how sorry he is. Elder Panda is disappointed but he does understand, as he too wanted to fly before he could run, but sometimes you have to start small before going big.</desc>

Natasha goes out of her comfort zone when considering some 18th-century pottery, but feels more at home when she spots something from the 1970s. Philip opts for some typically 'Serrell' items, as well as chewing over more prehistoric stuff. He also goes out of his way to prove that chivalry isn't dead. On the road, Philip visits a factory using the world-famous Sheffield steel to make some very fine tools, and Natasha heads to the woods for a spot of foraging and some free food.

      <desc lang="en">The recovery of a stolen gun leads the team to reinvestigate the death 40 years previously of Jacob Tarlow, a Jewish officer who was involved in recruiting black Americans into the navy in the 1970s. Tarlow had been targeted by Ku Klux Klan members and was found hanged from a tree, but the death was ruled as suicide. The reappearance of the victim's sidearm is enough evidence to reopen the case and the team is led to Tom Hamilton, an ex-police officer who it is claimed was involved in the attack.
