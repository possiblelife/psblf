    <title lang="en">Hey You What If?</title>
      <desc lang="en">So you want to build the tallest building on Earth? Ambitious but good on yer! This episode will tell you how, starting with how not to. Most tall buildings are tall and thin because land is expensive. But this isn’t the best design because the lowest floor has to take the weight of all the floors above it. And so eventually, you reach a limit where the structure at the bottom isn’t strong enough. If you want to make a building significantly higher, then you need to change the shape and instead take inspiration from wedding cakes. The bottom layers of a wedding cake get wider and wider, which means that they can take more and more weight. In fact, the tallest building ever conceived, the X-Seed 4000, is 4km high and can house a million people - but it’s never been built. However, even if you made a giant cone-shaped building, and assuming you have materials that are strong enough, then eventually you would reach another limit, when the weight of the building is too much for the ground </desc>

In this documentary, she shows us how she does her hair at home, doing her own hair, her mum's hair, her sister's hair, her friend's hair and even her dad's beard. Shemhas been doing lots of different hairstyles for everyone, inlcuding twists, braids (thick and small), plaits, tops buns, and also leaving it out as an afro, which is really good for the hair and scalp. Chelcea is an expert on the science of hair and how to look after it, and is particularity interested in natural hair remedies. Chelcea's parents encourage their daughter's passion and, through beautiful animation, we learn about her mum's childhood in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The What's in the Box? game reveals a wooden toy flower, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are all inspired by our environment. This theme is explored through exploration, play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate 'our environment' toy or object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler! Storytime is all about discovering new words, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear learn more about different ways they can help look after the Earth. Big Bear shows them how to turn off lights, use less water and recycle rubbish! Viewers at home show how they've been exploring the 'our environment' theme too. Plus,</desc>

The What's in the Box? game reveals a wooden toy aeroplane, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are all inspired by an 'in the air' theme. This subject is explored through exploration, play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate 'in the air' object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about joining in with physical actions, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear are given a kite as a present. The twins go outside to fly it, but things don't quite go to plan when the kite gets stuck in a tree! Viewers at home show how they've been exploring the 'in the air' theme too.

      <desc lang="en">A radical re-telling of the events that lead to the Second World War, this time focusing on the period between September 1938 and March 1939. In September 1938, Hitler makes his intention to invade Czechoslovakia known, but Britain and France make it clear they will go to war against Germany if he does so. On the night of 9 November in Germany, Nazi forces attack Jewish property and homes, killing many Jews and arresting thousands more. Known as Kristallnacht, this was the start of the Holocaust, which exposed Hitler and his horrific plans on the world stage. Finally, this episode travels back to 15 March 1939, when Hitler's troops marched across the border and occupied Czechoslovakia</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hijacked</title>
      <desc lang="en">The documentary series turns attention to events in London in April, 1980, when six armed men from Iran seized control of the capital's Iranian embassy. Holding 26 people at gunpoint, the terrorists demanded the immediate release of political prisoners incarcerated in their homeland, and safe passage from the UK. If these demands were not met, the men claimed they would shoot all 26 of their hostages. Forty years later, first-hand accounts from some of the hostages, interviews with John Dellow of the Metropolitan Police and Gen Michael Rose of the SAS, and recorded footage from the incident are all brought together to provide an insight into the six-day ordeal that ended in a dramatic rescue operation</desc>

The last of the great Victorian engineering triumphs, it has grown to symbolise Scotland as much as Edinburgh Castle, bagpipes or kilts. But, as Rob learns, this incredible engineering achievement was born from the tragedy of the 1879 Tay Bridge disaster, and 73 deaths were connected with its construction and immediate aftermath</desc>
