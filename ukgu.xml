Our 'buy and throw away' culture contributes to the global warming crisis so something has to be done. In a vivid animated world, we learn about the journey that many of our clothes make; from where they are manufactured, all the way to how they are transported to the UK high streets - but are there other alternatives when buying our clothes? Anita sets out to explore sustainable solutions for young people. She talks to environmentalist Zaqiya about her school initiative, Swop it Up, and Holly, manager of the UK's largest charity shop. Together they show us ways young people can buy fashionable clothes and look after the planet at the same time.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">When the Globe’s new owner Archibald Frost threatens to knock down the theatre to build a skyscraper, William Shakespeare and his players spring into action to convince him that plays are fun by staging As You Like It. The story begins with two brothers: kind Orlando and mean Oliver. Oliver refuses to share any of their father’s money with Orlando. Shakespeare introduces two more bickering brothers: nasty Duke Frederick and friendly Duke Senior. Duke Frederick is so nasty that he banishes Duke Senior from court for no reason other than being nicer than him. Frost meets cousins Rosalind and Celia; Rosalind is sad because her father Duke Senior has been banished. Celia tries to cheer up Rosalind, and together they talk about falling in love.</desc>

DK gives an insight into the impact this has on his daily life and his ongoing battle to find treatment or relief. As his condition has deteriorated, with his head falling further to one side, the more his life has been affected. A number of years ago, he had to give up playing football, weekly, with his friends, something which he very much misses and he is determined to try and play again. Will this be possible?</desc>

According to Buckley, the pair's boat was attacked by two people wearing military gear. The case takes a more sinister turn when Homeland Security agent John Russo arrives in town, investigating a report of an imminent threat to New Orleans from a foreign aggressor. Russo's intelligence states a small submarine has been deployed against US interests, and Greene's body bears all the hallmarks of being hit by a similar submersible.
