Inside Giovanna’s bag are colourful sheets of sandpaper, and all the parents and little ones have different objects and toys that feel rough. These are explored through discovery, play, song and story. Grown-ups at home are encouraged to take part by hiding a safe, baby-appropriate rough object or toy inside a fabric bag or pillowcase for them to reveal and explore with their baby! The nursery rhyme Michael Finnegan features, as does a story involving Baby Bear and Baby Tiger, and viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring rough things too.

We’ll discover a tree’s leaves make energy using sunlight, so they can keep growing. We learn that a tree is alive, it drinks and breathes and grows just like we do! And we’ll find out about deciduous trees that lose their leaves in winter and evergreens that keep their leaves all year round.</desc>

At the Museum of Cornish Treasures, Archie tells them that their treasure grew up in Cornwall under a big dome, and Suzy sends them to the Eden Project to find out more. Here, they meet Catherine who says their treasure is a type of fruit from a place far away. But how did the fruit get to Cornwall? Suzy buzzes on the Treasure Comm and suggests Fred and Pete take a trip on a zip wire and explore the tropical dome. They meet Catherine again who reveals their treasure is a screw pine fruit. This fruit is usually found in hot countries in Asia and Africa but is able to grow in Eden’s dome because it's so warm inside. Catherine takes Fred and Pete on a plant hunt around the tropical dome. Catherine explains how fruits produce seeds which then grow into new trees that produce fruits themselves</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Once dubbed the 'murder capital' of the world, for nearly three decades, rival gangs ruled the streets of El Salvador through a regime of violence, extortion and fear. That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>

A star who is in demand on stages across the world, Bryn has stayed true to his Welsh roots and is a great proponent for Welsh culture. He invites Zeinab behind the scenes not only at the Royal Opera House where he is a regular performer, but also in his native Wales where he still lives and where he is recording an album of traditional folk songs. He was chosen personally by King Charles to sing at his coronation. Zeinab visits the Welsh National Opera which launched Bryn's international career and speaks to WNO general director, Aidan Lang who oversaw his debut performance. The WNO's touring wardrobe manager Judith Russell, shows Zeinab Sir Bryn's costume as Falstaff in the opera by Verdi and explains how she was tasked with dressing him for this iconic role. We meet young Welsh singers performing at the same local singing competitions that Bryn sang in as a young boy and ask how he inspires them t</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Marking the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the HMT Empire Windrush to British shores in 1948, this documentary follows a remarkable project spearheaded by His Majesty King Charles III, who has commissioned ten leading artists, from Britain and abroad, to create portraits of ten pioneering members of the Windrush Generation. The completed portraits will become part of the Royal Collection and stand as a lasting memorial to all the men, women and children who came to Britain from the Caribbean and gave so much of themselves to rebuild a nation devasted by war. Featuring first-person testimony from the Windrush sitters, many of whom are in their 90s, as they speak frankly about their experiences of arriving in Britain; making lives for themselves and the overwhelming contribution they have made to their communities and the nation as a whole. The film also follows the making of the portraits, as artist and sitter come together, with the artists reflecting on their own experience of und</desc>

That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Zeinab Badawi meets Sir Bryn Terfel, one of the most distinguished singers of our age. A star who is in demand on stages across the world, Bryn has stayed true to his Welsh roots and is a great proponent for Welsh culture. He invites Zeinab behind the scenes not only at the Royal Opera House where he is a regular performer, but also in his native Wales where he still lives and where he is recording an album of traditional folk songs. He was chosen personally by King Charles to sing at his coronation. Zeinab visits the Welsh National Opera which launched Bryn's international career and speaks to WNO general director, Aidan Lang who oversaw his debut performance. The WNO's touring wardrobe manager Judith Russell, shows Zeinab Sir Bryn's costume as Falstaff in the opera by Verdi and explains how she was tasked with dressing him for this iconic role. We meet young Welsh singers performing at the same local singing competitions that Bryn sang in as a young boy and ask how he inspires them t</desc>
