Also featured is the sharp-toothed majungasaurus, a predator of much smaller creatures that would occasionally turn cannibal and hunt its own kind</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Two teams touch down at the STARS space station to take on three scientific challenges to win out-of-this world prizes. First, they must guide magnetic rockets out of the Magnet Maze, dodging comets and stars along the way. Then, the teams must work out which season James is talking about by standing under the correct tree. If they’re correct, they’ll get covered in spring blossom, summer sunlight, autumn leaves or winter snow! Finally, a player from each team must memorise a pattern of animals on the Memory Path, before guiding their partner across it. In the lab, Sam, Ayo and James complete a quiz to find out which animals they share qualities with. But who is the eagle, the herring gull or the dung beetle?</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May embark on a project to build a car that can turn into a hovercraft and bring relief to flooded areas. Their efforts do not start smoothly, but it is not long before the trio are demonstrating the brilliance of their creation with an eventful journey down the River Avon. Plus, Jeremy grabs the keys to two variants of the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG supercar - the V8-engined Black Series with a roaring 622bhp, and the 740bhp Electric Drive, which is powered by four electric motors. X-Men and Les Miserables star Hugh Jackman is the latest celebrity to take the new Reasonably Priced Car around the test track</desc>

Having concluded their primary appeal is to caravanners, the duo spend a couple of days in models by Mazda and Volkswagen and try to get a feel for what life is like for the people they believe would buy one. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond drives a pair of exciting Lamborghinis in Italy - the ferocious Aventador Roadster and the limited-edition Sesto Elemento, which carries an eye-watering price tag of around £2million. Two cars are also put through their paces on the test track, with James in a modern re-creation of the classic Porsche 911 and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler in the rather less exotic Reasonably Priced Car</desc>
