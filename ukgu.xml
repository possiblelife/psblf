      <desc lang="en">Danger Mouse's over-reliance on gadgets prompts Colonel K to send his top agent on a tech-free nature retreat. Unbeknownst to Danger Mouse, Greenback has the same plans for his daughter, Delilah, whose social media obsession has also spiralled out of control. Back at HQ Penfold is tasked with protecting the entire world from the threat of super-villainy. Stripped off his gadgets, DM struggles to adapt to life in the wilderness and, when a talking pinecone called Conni begins to offer him survival tips, he begins to question his own sanity. Soon enough, Delilah catches wind of DM's presence and she plots to destroy him as a means of getting back into her Dad's good books. With the voices of Alexander Armstrong and Kevin Eldon</desc>

They’re able to see where they nest in burrows and hunt for food by diving into the sea. And Chantelle joins Aneeshwar, who is a keen bird watcher - together they try to spot a puffling, a baby puffin, in the cliffs. Chantelle and Rory’s fact files help answer all of Emily’s questions. With the help of the special poem, we discover that like lots of other teeny tiny creatures, puffins are superheroes, helping our planet in their own special way. And for this episode’s Teeny Tiny Task, Rory and Sandy decide to be 'more puffin' and decorate each other’s faces with faceprints.</desc>

Elder Chick demonstrates the Fluffytown nap timer and explains when she presses the button it's time to snooze, and when the hand reaches the balloon, it's time for the Siesta Fiesta. She starts the timer, and everyone hurries off to their nap stations to begin their naps. As the other Fluffytowners start to doze off, Love Monster struggles to fall asleep. After trying a pre-nap workout with Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny, practising yoga with Book Cub and pillow drumming with Bad Idea Puppy, a frustrated Love Monster gives up and thinks he might as well start getting ready for the party. He heads over to his decks and puts on a song just before the sleep timer goes off, and everyone awakes full of energy. As everyone boogies to the beats, Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny looks over to the decks, but Love Monster is nowhere to be seen. She </desc>

      <desc lang="en">A cinema documentary entirely in Scottish Gaelic, Iorram (Boat Song) is a lyrical portrait of life in Scotland's Outer Hebrides, past and present. Director Alastair Cole takes the audience on an immersive journey into the heart and soul of a 1000-year-old community, blending archive sound recordings of voices from the past with visuals of island life today and an original score by acclaimed folk musician Aidan O'Rourke. At the core of the film is an extraordinary trove of sound archive, recorded by pioneering Scottish ethnographers in the mid-20th century, who visited the Western Isles to capture the hardship and romance of life lived in precarious balance with the sea. These newly restored recordings preserve an oral history of lore and legends, tall tales and tragedies, passed down through generations of Gaelic speakers. This soundtrack of voices, stories and songs from the past is accompanied by moving imagery of the daily working rhythm of the islands, on land and on water, shot ov</desc>

He sets off on a 10,000-mile journey from the west to the east, to explore the vast swathe of islands that are scattered beyond America's shores. The first port of call on his journey is Hawaii, and his exploration looks beyond its image as a tourist paradise, crammed with sun-kissed beaches and world-class surfing, and into the havoc wreaked by advancing lava fields and smoking craters. Leaving Hawaii, Martin flies 2,500 miles north to the islands of Alaska, where the contrast couldn't be more extreme, from tropical rain forests to snow-fringed glaciers, and from crowded beaches to some of America's most sparsely populated territories</desc>
