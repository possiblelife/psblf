Their first stop is the Valley of the Temples, the remains of a huge Greek city featuring some of the best examples of classical Greek architecture anywhere in the world. From there, they hit the white beaches of Porta Bianca before taking in some more history in Syracuse. Today, it is just a provincial city, but more than 2,700 years ago it was one of the largest colonies in the ancient Greek world, and some of the original buildings remain inside the city's Archaeological Park. Their final stop is the island's second city Catania, a place very significant to Giovanni as he moved there aged 14 to further his dance career</desc>

This theme is explored through exploration, play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate babies object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about discovering new words, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear help Big Bear to look after Baby Bear. The twins help change, feed and bath Baby Bear. Viewers at home show how they've been exploring the babies theme too. Plus, the Benjee and Bailee Say Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with stretchin</desc>

On the way, they see what they can spot in a rock pool and have a picnic of some snacks made from seaweed!</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Strictly Come Dancing stars Anton Du Beke and Giovanni Pernice embark on a tour of Giovanni's homeland Sicily, beginning in the port town of Sciacca. Their first stop is the Valley of the Temples, the remains of a huge Greek city featuring some of the best examples of classical Greek architecture anywhere in the world. From there, they hit the white beaches of Porta Bianca before taking in some more history in Syracuse. Today, it is just a provincial city, but more than 2,700 years ago it was one of the largest colonies in the ancient Greek world, and some of the original buildings remain inside the city's Archaeological Park. Their final stop is the island's second city Catania, a place very significant to Giovanni as he moved there aged 14 to further his dance career</desc>

From there, they hit the white beaches of Porta Bianca before taking in some more history in Syracuse. Today, it is just a provincial city, but more than 2,700 years ago it was one of the largest colonies in the ancient Greek world, and some of the original buildings remain inside the city's Archaeological Park. Their final stop is the island's second city Catania, a place very significant to Giovanni as he moved there aged 14 to further his dance career</desc>

From there, they hit the white beaches of Porta Bianca before taking in some more history in Syracuse. Today, it is just a provincial city, but more than 2,700 years ago it was one of the largest colonies in the ancient Greek world, and some of the original buildings remain inside the city's Archaeological Park.

The Essex crew are back and in full holiday mode - Essex's very own Ken and Barbie, Amber and Dan, are defiant when Dan becomes the hot topic of conversation as a voice note makes the rounds insinuating that Dan got too friendly on a night out with one of Amber's least favourite people! Meanwhile, Lockie has brought his friend Jordan along on the trip and continues with big lifestyle changes including rebuilding his friendship with ex-girlfriend Yaz. Yaz also welcomes good friend Junaid, who is a well-known face in Essex, but where are his allegiances when it comes to his old friends Courtney, Chloe M and Amber? After back-to-back to fights with Billy, Amy is re-assessing their relationship and testing if absence really makes the heart grow fonder - she is also on hand to lend a sympathetic ear to Saff, who is about to turn 30 and is really not looking forward to this milestone birthday.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">In 1996, women began to disappear off the streets of Claremont, sending shockwaves through the wealthy suburb of Perth and all of Australia. A community lived in fear and the perpetrator simply disappeared, leaving behind a chilling trail of rape and murder. It took more than 20 years and the assistance of FBI profilers and British forensic experts to uncover the identity of the killer, who was someone already in the system. Through the lens of the surviving victims, this documentary reveals how society can enable a serial killer to hide in plain sight - and the devastating legacy of a series of terrifying disappearances</desc>

      <desc lang="en">In the mid-1970s, London and the south-east of England saw a series of murders, the last of which was that of a Catholic priest found bludgeoned to death with an axe. The culprit was eventually found to be Patrick Mackay, who had been diagnosed at the age of 15 as being a potential psychopathic killer and whose behaviour became stranger and more extreme as he grew older. With the help of contributions from those who encountered him, psychologists and criminologists attempt to unravel whether Mackay was predisposed to become a murderer</desc>

      <desc lang="en">A radical re-telling of the events that lead to the Second World War, this time focusing on the period between September 1938 and March 1939. In September 1938, Hitler makes his intention to invade Czechoslovakia known, but Britain and France make it clear they will go to war against Germany if he does so. On the night of 9 November in Germany, Nazi forces attack Jewish property and homes, killing many Jews and arresting thousands more. Known as Kristallnacht, this was the start of the Holocaust, which exposed Hitler and his horrific plans on the world stage. Finally, this episode travels back to 15 March 1939, when Hitler's troops marched across the border and occupied Czechoslovakia</desc>

      <desc lang="en">The documentary series turns attention to events in London in April, 1980, when six armed men from Iran seized control of the capital's Iranian embassy. Holding 26 people at gunpoint, the terrorists demanded the immediate release of political prisoners incarcerated in their homeland, and safe passage from the UK. If these demands were not met, the men claimed they would shoot all 26 of their hostages. Forty years later, first-hand accounts from some of the hostages, interviews with John Dellow of the Metropolitan Police and Gen Michael Rose of the SAS, and recorded footage from the incident are all brought together to provide an insight into the six-day ordeal that ended in a dramatic rescue operation</desc>

Jeremy Clarkson pilots the Lexus LFA, which has a spectacularly high-revving V10 powerplant, Richard Hammond gets behind the wheel of the muscular Dodge Viper, and James May opts for the latest incarnation of Aston Martin's Vanquish. On their journey from Las Vegas to Palm Springs via Los Angeles, the presenters tackle racing circuits and find themselves in a race against the police, before rushing to the Mexican border - and there's a terrifying penalty for the last man to arrive.

A price restriction leads Jeremy to grab the keys to a Shelby Mustang GT500, which costs the equivalent of £35,000 in America and packs a supercharged punch of more than 650bhp. James and Richard pin their hopes on the pan-European rail network in a bid to secure the prize of tickets to a top-flight football match, with nothing but a long journey home awaiting the losers. On the test track, Jeremy puts Toyota's GT86 coupe through its paces, and its promise of entertaining rear-wheel-drive handling should put a smile on his face.
