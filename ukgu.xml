Today, it’s the third and last semi-final in which three of the artists who made it through have to create a piece for our celebrity commissioner, Dr Ronx. For their masterpiece they must make a work of art based on the theme of community. Before they do that though they pay a visit to Ronx’s hometown of London. There they help out at a community centre and learn more about their commissioner. They then return to the Art Studio to create their artworks in 2 hour and 30 minutes. But who will Ricky and Sadie pick to go through to the final? And will that person become Britain’s Best Young Artist?</desc>

Now they are no longer a threat, the team follows the ants into their tree. Ubercorn and Glitch tuck into their picnic, but an ant steals the cherry from Glitch’s cake and takes it inside the tree. Unable fit inside, Glitch uses his size-ray to shrink himself and zooms after the ant. Inside the tree, the ants see Glitch as a threat and start to surround him.

Lars loves these tough little birds and explains how, although they spend most of their lives flying out to sea and fishing, they return to land each year to lay their eggs. When the baby birds, also called pufflings, eventually hatch, they fly out towards the ocean. But the light from nearby towns often confuses them about where to go, leading local children and adults to form 'puffin patrols' to rescue the pufflings. Lars is excited to help out but is upset when he discovers Glitch, also a fan of puffins, is already well-known on the islands for his skills as a puffin rescuer. Although Glitch offers him a place in his puffin patrol, Lars is determined to outdo Glitch with a patrol of his own - but when he recruits a clumsy Grimbot, things take a turn for the worse...</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Tahira wants to find out all about water voles in today’s episode. Chantelle heads up the river with some friends looking for signs of water voles, and Rory meets an expert on them in the city. Chantelle and Rory’s fact files help answer all of Tahira questions. With the help of the Teeny Tiny Creatures poem, we discover that, like lots of other teeny tiny creatures, water voles are superheroes and help our planet in their own special way. In the Teeny Tiny Task, Chantelle and the children create water vole masks.</desc>

Duggee calls the Squirrels to come for some blueberry juice, but as Tag is running, he trips over a car and falls through a secret door in the wall! Communicating through his walkie-talkie, Tag doesn't know where he is. He can see lots and lots of things around him, but no-one has any idea where this room is in the house. As Duggee listens to Tag describe what's in the room, he realises that Tag must be in the lost property room. But Duggee doesn't know where in the house that is. He's going to need to go find the map of the house which he has hidden somewhere. Whilst Tag explores all the treasures of the lost property room, the Squirrels search for hints to where the map could be around the Clubhouse.

      <desc lang="en">Once dubbed the 'murder capital' of the world, for nearly three decades, rival gangs ruled the streets of El Salvador through a regime of violence, extortion and fear. That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>
