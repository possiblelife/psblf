For their inspiration day, the artists head to Blackpool, where Ricky teaches them a cool collage technique at the top of the tower, before they head to the theme park to take photos for their final masterpiece. The artists then return to the art studio to create their artworks in the time given. But who will Ricky and Sadie pick to go through to the first semi-final?

Kika knows the way like the back of her paw, but there are some important things they must do along the way. Kika has to help Dr Amit navigate a pelican crossing, using a top secret cone to cross the road safely. Then she must guide him through the station and up the escalator to the platform. There are some hazards to avoid, including a tumbling box full of Kika’s favourite snacks - carrots! Then, at the station, their mission is almost derailed by a last-minute platform change.

      <desc lang="en">Nigel, Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear welcome toddlers Joshua, Inam, Liyana, Maisy, Francis and Arabella, and their grown-ups, to the Toddler Club. Parents, carers and their little ones at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! The What’s in the Box? game reveals a pair of stripy socks, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are inspired by patterns. This theme is explored through play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate patterns toy or object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about discovering new words, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear draw different patterns at home and outside. From zigzags in the mud to swirls in the bath bubbles, the twins have lots of arty fun! Viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring the patterns theme too. Plus, The Circle Song gets everyone moving about, </desc>

However, Italy are seemingly on an upward curve and will be buoyed by a memorable 22-21 win in Cardiff last March and by an impressive 28-27 victory over Australia in November.

      <desc lang="en">Detective drama set in a 1950s Cambridgeshire village, where local vicar Sidney Chambers (James Norton) develops a sideline in sleuthing - with the initially reluctant help of grumpy DI Geordie Keating (Robson Green). The cleric's first case finds him presiding over the funeral of a solicitor, who is believed to have taken his own life. However, the dead man's mistress has a different theory - and feeling unable to go to the police, she asks Sidney to examine it for her. He uncovers evidence that the suicide was staged, but while he's busy delving into the personal life of the victim, will the vicar miss his own big chance with Amanda Kendall (Morven Christie), the woman he secretly loves? With Tessa Peake-Jones, Kacey Ainsworth and Rachel Shelley</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Poor Sidney. His sister Jen bullies him into attending Amanda's engagement dinner - seeing the love of his life celebrate her betrothal to another man is the last thing the village vicar wants. He sinks a few too many drinks in a bid to make the evening more palatable, but it doesn't work - in fact, nobody at the event seems happy. Tensions rise between Amanda and Jen's old school friends, and then matters erupt when Jen's boyfriend Johnny (Ukweli Roach, Starlings) is accused of stealing Amanda's engagement ring. Later, the unfortunate chap is accused of murdering one of his fellow guests, and evidence at the scene of the crime seems to back up the theory. But Sidney isn't convinced - can he unmask the real killer?</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Jack bought his bachelor pad nearly a decade ago, well before he met Clifton and they adopted two sons. With lack of space now a serious problem, the couple have spent two frustrating years looking for the perfect property. To make matters worse, their current home is overrun with toys and poor design choices, and is hardly a magnet for buyers. Drew and Jonathan Scott are convinced that, with a few key improvements, they can sell the couple's current house for a good price and get them settled into a sprawling new abode</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Michael Portillo embarks on a new journey following his Bradshaw's handbook from south-west Wales to Cambridge, beginning in Pembroke Dock, where Queen Victoria's royal yachts were built. In the little market town of Naberth he investigates what caused rebels to dress up as women, later spending the night at an inn in Carmarthen where Horatio Nelson once met Emma Hamilton. Next day, the former politician pitches in with the volunteers who look after the Gwili Heritage line and ends his leg in Swansea, where he learns how to pose for a photograph in Victorian style</desc>

    <title lang="en">Motorway Patrol</title>
      <desc lang="en">Documentary following members of the New Zealand highway patrol as they witness some of the best and worst behaviour on the nation's motorways. The series is centred around the roads of Auckland, the country's largest urban area, and features motoring chaos including major traffic collisions, escaped animals and pedestrians on busy roads. There is also footage of drivers falling asleep at the wheel, overloaded vehicles and suspects caught with illegal substances - plus a host of excuses as the people pulled over try to persuade officers they have not done anything wrong</desc>
