While watching his favourite show about a villain who can lift anything with mind-power, our hero finds out that he can do it, too. And not only that, he finds out that the villain in the show is real when he goes outside to put the rubbish out.

After all, even non-existent powers would have to obey some of the key rules of physics, like conservation of momentum, conservation of energy and conservation of mass.

      <desc lang="en">Nigel, Bailee Bear and Benjee Bair welcome toddlers Eesa, Sebastian, Francis, Jemima and Afal, and their grown-ups to the Toddler Club. Parents, carers and their little ones at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! The What's in the Box? game reveals a photograph of Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear sharing a story, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are all about taking turns. This theme is explored through exploration, play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate taking-turns toy or object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about discovering new words, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear learn how to play together nicely and the importance of taking turns. Viewers at home show how they've been exploring the taking-turns theme too. Plus, the Benjee and Bailee Say Song gets everyone moving abou</desc>

Millions of children have been forced to leave their homes to escape the fighting, but many either others couldn’t or didn’t. Hearing from just some of those who are living through war, this film lets the children caught in the conflict tell their stories in their own words. Covering fear, loss, strength and hope, they detail the life-changing events of the war and the impact it is having on their day-to-day life. They share their experiences of surviving attacks from the air, being forced to live for weeks at a time in bomb shelters, and their towns and villages becoming occupied by Russian soldiers. Ricky Boleto finds out how the children are coping with living in a country at war.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">The war in Ukraine is the biggest in Europe since World War II. Millions of children have been forced to leave their homes to escape the fighting, but many either others couldn’t or didn’t. Hearing from just some of those who are living through war, this film lets the children caught in the conflict tell their stories in their own words. Covering fear, loss, strength and hope, they detail the life-changing events of the war and the impact it is having on their day-to-day life. They share their experiences of surviving attacks from the air, being forced to live for weeks at a time in bomb shelters, and their towns and villages becoming occupied by Russian soldiers. Ricky Boleto finds out how the children are coping with living in a country at war.</desc>

While they enjoy the views they also get a seven-course meal - with today's starter cooked by Gino</desc>

      <desc lang="en">In June 1985, TWA flight 847 made a routine stop-off in Athens, Greece. Its destination was Rome, but that changed after armed Lebanese militia boarded the plane. Against the backdrop of the Middle East conflict, the terrorists had one objective in mind - the release of hundreds of Islamic prisoners detained in Israel. Seizing the US airliner shortly after take-off, the passengers and crew - including singer Demis Roussos - endured a three-day ordeal involving a stream of landings across various airports. This documentary recalls their experiences</desc>

If these demands were not met, the men claimed they would shoot all 26 of their hostages. Forty years later, first-hand accounts from some of the hostages, interviews with John Dellow of the Metropolitan Police and Gen Michael Rose of the SAS, and recorded footage from the incident are all brought together to provide an insight into the six-day ordeal that ended in a dramatic rescue operation</desc>

Both teams have enjoyed encouraging campaigns so far and look likely to finish in the top half of the table, but it was Fulham who claimed a 3-2 win when the London rivals met in August. Goals by Bobby Decordova-Reid and Joao Palhinha gave them a 2-0 lead, only for Chirstian Norgaard and Ivan Toney to draw Brentford level, before Aleksandar Mitrovic's late strike settled it for the Cottagers</desc>
