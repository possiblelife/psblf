Novak Djokovic continued his march to a fourth successive title at this stage last year with a routine 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Thanasi Kokkinakis on Centre Court. Over on the No.1 Court, there was an upset when second seed Anett Kontaveit was beaten 6-4, 6-0 by Jule Niemeier in her first match against a top 10 player. That match was followed by a 7-6, 7-5 win for 2021 runner-up Karolina Pliskova against Tereza Martincova. Meanwhile, there were mixed fortunes for two former champions on Court No.2, with Garbine Muguruza losing 6-4, 6-0 to Greet Minnen, and Angelique Kerber prevailing 6-3, 6-3 against Magda Linette</desc>

Unfortunately, the spread of this remarkable plant is leading to the destruction of the rainforests, particularly in Borneo and Sumatra. So what can we do?

They discover how the NHS came to be, some of its weirder moments, and what life was like before we had the NHS to look after us.

We take a look at the role of the almoner, who decided who would have to pay for their treatment, and how much, before Nye Bevan comes along with his notion of free health care for all. We learn the story of the first NHS baby (and how she was encouraged to wait a few minutes before actually coming into the world), of how nurses were recruited in large numbers and how, with ventures such as the Common Cold Unit, the NHS tried to learn about how our health could be improved using some weird and wonderful methods.

      <desc lang="en">Live coverage of the second day from the All England Club, featuring the first round of the men's and ladies' singles competitions. Elena Rybakina is scheduled to get proceedings under way on Centre Court this afternoon following her victory over Ons Jabeur in the 2022 final. As 2021 title-winner Ashleigh Barty had retired, the honour normally reserved for the champion fell to top seed Iga Swiatek last year, and she claimed a routine 6-0, 6-3 victory over qualifier Jana Fett. She was followed by Rafael Nadal, who prevailed in four sets against Francisco Cerundolo, but the two-time champion looks set to miss out this time around due to injury</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dickensian</title>
      <desc lang="en">Period drama re-imagining the works of Charles Dickens as inter-connected tales, set in a fictional version of 19th-century London. The likes of Oliver Twist's Fagin and the Artful Dodger live alongside and interact with the wealthy Barbarys of Bleak House, and the homely Cratchitts of A Christmas Carol, in events that eventually set up the stories featured in their respective novels. The saga begins on Christmas Eve, as Amelia and Arthur Havisham gather to hear the reading of their father's will, and the ruthless nature of debt collector Jacob Marley appears to give someone a motive for murder. Starring Stephen Rea, Pauline Collins, Caroline Quentin, Tom Weston-Jones, Tuppence Middleton, Anton Lesser and Omid Djalili</desc>

He resumes his journey on Eriskay, where he discovers how the remote location helped preserve a unique way of life for centuries - and also allowed locals to hide thousands of bottles of whisky from the excise men when a ship laden with the thirst-quenching cargo ran aground in 1941. The story inspired the 1949 movie Whisky Galore! Moving on to Barra, Paul goes foraging for cockles and visits the only airport in the world where scheduled flights land on the beach, then heads across to Vatersay, where he joins local fishermen trawling for lobsters</desc>
