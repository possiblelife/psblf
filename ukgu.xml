When the try-outs are cancelled due to the coach not being available, Mr Salford steps in and offers his services as coach. Mrs Griggs is horrified - she could do without the chaos he inevitably brings with him - but he won't take no for an answer. Jas and her father are really superstitious and when things start going wrong Jas thinks she's jinxed, and then that she's passed on the jinx to her dad. When she's not picked as goalie for the team Jas is actually relieved - it must mean she's still jinxed and hasn't passed on the jinx to her dad. Eventually Jas does need to play in goal, but when she saves a crucial penalty she and her dad are delighted to realise they are not jinxed after all, just accident-prone!

When Mrs Griggs tells Martha a winning personality as well as academic achievement is vital in order to get into a top university, Martha panics and is determined to succeed in the social skills class and prove she does indeed have a winning personality. Mrs Griggs volunteers a reluctant Mr Malone to take the classes and hands him a book written by her beloved 'Guru Holeman' called Being Whole as a manual to help him. When Lily is mistakenly led to believe by Jas that Matt is emigrating to Australia she is distraught that he hasn't even told her he's leaving. She becomes convinced it's because she's too easy-going that he hasn't even bothered to tell her. She begs Mrs Griggs to let her go to social skills class, too, so she can learn to be less easy-going. Ollie is then sent there for being too pompous and Jas for being too exuberant.

Poor Tina has a hook stuck in her mouth and is too weak to swim. After Peso tends to her wound, the Octonauts agree to help get her to the tuna spawning grounds. But they’ll have to be quick: egg-laying season doesn’t last long. Luckily, Tweak’s latest gup, the Gup-R, is the fastest she’s ever built! The Octonauts use it to tow Tina, but when the Gup-R’s battery dies, how will they catch up to the rest of her school?</desc>

It’s off to the Museum of Cornish Treasures to see if Suzy and Archie have any clues. They reckon it’s something to do with ships and send Fred and Pete off to Charlestown Harbour. There they spot a large ship but are collared by the ship’s captain as they climb on board – not any old ship’s captain, but a pirate captain! Fred and Pete are thrilled to learn that their sheet is, in fact, a pirate flag - a Jolly Roger, used by pirates to warn other ships that they’re on their way to take their goods. After dressing up as pirates, Suzy sends them off to Shipwreck Treasure Museum where museum curator Daniel explains all about pirate treasure like gold and silver coins.

Find out how we can help to look after them and our planet, and why and how they grow and survive in different climates. Maddie explores plants in the rainforest, big and small, and sees how the clever drip-tip leaves work watering the plants beneath them. We’ll see how plants in hot, dry parts of world like the desert thrive in their own special ways, like the cactus plant that stores litres of water in its waxy leaves. And we’ll learn how plants that grow close to home in the UK, can grow in a colder and wetter climate.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Paul Murton visits Gigha and Jura, two islands of the Inner Hebrides that are only a few miles apart but could not be more different. He begins at the Achamore Gardens on Gigha, which were created in the 1930s by the malted-drink millionaire James Horlick. He loved Gigha's mild climate so much that he bought the island and made it his home. Today Gigha is owned by the community, and many of its residents are incomers attracted by the opportunity to begin a new island life on this small and fertile place. Where Gigha is small, lush and verdant, Jura is rugged and awe-inspiring. Despite being one of Scotland's largest islands, just 200 people live there - alongside more than 5,000 deer</desc>
