The What’s in the Box? game reveals a pair of stripy socks, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are inspired by patterns. This theme is explored through play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate patterns toy or object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about discovering new words, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear draw different patterns at home and outside. From zigzags in the mud to swirls in the bath bubbles, the twins have lots of arty fun! Viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring the patterns theme too.

And Chantelle joins Aneeshwar, who is a keen bird watcher - together they try to spot a puffling, a baby puffin, in the cliffs. Chantelle and Rory’s fact files help answer all of Emily’s questions.

      <desc lang="en">The Go Jetters are going to Westman Islands, Iceland, where the world's largest colony of Atlantic puffins gathers every year. Lars loves these tough little birds and explains how, although they spend most of their lives flying out to sea and fishing, they return to land each year to lay their eggs. When the baby birds, also called pufflings, eventually hatch, they fly out towards the ocean. But the light from nearby towns often confuses them about where to go, leading local children and adults to form 'puffin patrols' to rescue the pufflings. Lars is excited to help out but is upset when he discovers Glitch, also a fan of puffins, is already well-known on the islands for his skills as a puffin rescuer. Although Glitch offers him a place in his puffin patrol, Lars is determined to outdo Glitch with a patrol of his own - but when he recruits a clumsy Grimbot, things take a turn for the worse...</desc>

The What’s in the Box? game reveals a wooden triangle toy, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are inspired by shapes. This theme is explored through play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate shapes toy or object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about discovering new words, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear look for lots of different shapes at home and when they’re out and about. Viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring the shapes theme too. Plus, The Circle Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with stretching and the Goodbye song.</desc>

Tinks uses her superfetch skills to help Charli every day. The smallest of the Dog Squad gang, Tinks is a little Lhasa Apso with lots of big dog energy. Charli has been invited to a party but is feeling a bit nervous about going. Tinks loves helping Charli feel confident. She wants to help Charli feel good about herself so she can go and have fun at the party. Tinks fetches Charli’s hair brush so Charli can brush her newly-dyed pink hair, and then helps Charli choose a party outfit. And, when Charli can’t find her keys, Tinks dives into a mountain of clothes on the bed to search for them. Now they’re party ready, but it's raining! Tinks is determined to help Charli get to the party, even in the rain. But how? She summons all her big dog energy and sets off in search of a plan. Just wait until Dog Squad hear about this!</desc>
