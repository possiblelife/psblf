Love Monster goes to Elder Panda to ask his advice, and he tells him there are many ways to serve hot chocolate - each person needs to find their own unique way. Elder Panda adds honey and banana from his garden to his. Love Monster starts the ceremony by adding his signature marshmallows, but then Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny announces she puts marshmallows in hers too. Love Monster thinks he needs to use something more unusual, so he adds pickles, but this doesn't go down well - in fact, it tastes horrible! It turns out the reason why he was chosen was so that he could make hot chocolate the way he always makes it. He does, and everyone loves it.</desc>
