Suzy rings on the Treasure Comm and directs Fred and Pete to visit a huer’s hut on the cliffs above Newquay.

Karl then shows Fred and Pete how the huer would use signals to get the fishing fleet into position. Fred and Pete decide to put this to the test. Unfortunately, the wind and a swarm of bees play havoc with Pete’s directions, but Fred somehow ends up back in the fishmonger, where he buys some Cornish sardines. Suzy ring</desc>

Then, in a game based on light and shadows, the young scientists have to figure out what their team captains are holding by observing their shadows behind a huge screen. Finally, the teams must take items from a giant conveyer belt and sort them so they can be reused and recycled. To make it even trickier, the players are attached to bungee cords! In the lab, Sam sits in a bathtub hoping he can come up with a eureka moment of discovery – just like his hero, the ancient Greek scientist Archimedes.</desc>

After many failed guesses, they decide to take the metal blob to the museum. Suzy and Archie recognise that the metal blob is made of bronze, an important metal in early Cornish history. Thousands of years ago, bronze was used to make tools all over the county during a period called the Bronze Age. They meet archaeologist James, who explains how the discovery of bronze allowed people to make tools that were stronger and faster than the stone tools used before. Suzy rings them on the Treasure Comm to tell them how Bronze Age people used to live in what are called round houses. She sends them to one nearby to find out exactly what life was like back then. After changing into some Bronze Age clothing, Fred and Pete check out the round house and discover that Bronze Age people were kept very busy with simple, everyday tasks </desc>

      <desc lang="en">Once dubbed the 'murder capital' of the world, for nearly three decades, rival gangs ruled the streets of El Salvador through a regime of violence, extortion and fear. That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Marking the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the HMT Empire Windrush to British shores in 1948, cameras follow a project spearheaded by King Charles.

      <desc lang="en">Once dubbed the 'murder capital' of the world, for nearly three decades, rival gangs ruled the streets of El Salvador through a regime of violence, extortion and fear. That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>
