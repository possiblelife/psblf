Then, in a game based on light and shadows, the young scientists have to figure out what their team captains are holding by observing their shadows behind a huge screen. Finally, the teams must take items from a giant conveyer belt and sort them so they can be reused and recycled. To make it even trickier, the players are attached to bungee cords! In the lab, Sam sits in a bathtub hoping he can come up with a eureka moment of discovery – just like his hero, the ancient Greek scientist Archimedes.</desc>

The fisherman wakes to discover a long, long, long fish at the end of his line. The Twirlywoo Screen draws a small line that Chickedy and Chick help make longer. Toodloo helps the line get a little longer still but when Great BigHoo taps the screen, the line becomes so long it shoots off the Twirlywoo Screen. The line gets longer and longer and goes into the Big Red Boat - right into Peekaboo's house! The Twirlywoos run after the Twirly Rings whilst Peekaboo reels in the long line</desc>

Once they are stirred together, the casserole dish can be placed in the oven to cook. Jessica wears a traditional Ukrainian outfit and serves drinks in a beautiful drinks dispenser.

Although Molly loves the creative chaos of Kez’s stall, she agrees to help Kez tidy up before the inspection.

    <title lang="en">Women and Gambling: My Secret Addiction</title>
      <desc lang="en">Over the last five years, the number of women seeking help for gambling addiction has more than doubled in the UK, according to the charity GambleAware. As many women grapple with the stigma of addiction, the BBC has been given exclusive access to the first women's residential treatment centre for gambling, based in central England. In this film, Rachel Stonehouse explores the issues around women and gambling addiction, both in the UK and around the world, and asks why it is a secret for so many.</desc>

Their first stop in County Clare is a miniature modern marvel called Teeroneer, a timber-clad, prize-winning property with a sunken kitchen that Sandi just can't resist cooking in. From there the pair head to Ark Ranch Treehouse. Hand-built by one woman, Sandi and Eddie are charmed by the sense of childhood adventure they feel. Finally, they head to Lost Cottage in the mountains and lakes of County Kerry.

Below ground, he investigates New York City's inaugural subway, and the dangers faced by the 'sandhogs' who built it. Progressing along the Long Island Railroad to Queens, Michael takes in an ambitious engineering project and a model town built by an Irish immigrant who became one of America's richest men. Later, he heads to the island's Gold Coast, where he relives the fun of 'the roaring twenties' at Oheka Castle, and concludes this leg of his trip at the Montauk lighthouse on Long Island's eastern-most tip</desc>

A community lived in fear and the perpetrator simply disappeared, leaving behind a chilling trail of rape and murder.

Through the lens of the surviving victims, this documentary reveals how society can enable a serial killer to hide in plain sight - and the devastating legacy of a series of terrifying disappearances</desc>
