      <desc lang="en">Join Jessie Cave and judges, Sadie Clayton and Ricky Martin, in the search for Britain’s Best Young Artist. Today, it’s the third and last semi-final in which three of the artists who made it through have to create a piece for our celebrity commissioner, Dr Ronx. For their masterpiece they must make a work of art based on the theme of community. Before they do that though they pay a visit to Ronx’s hometown of London. There they help out at a community centre and learn more about their commissioner. They then return to the Art Studio to create their artworks in 2 hour and 30 minutes. But who will Ricky and Sadie pick to go through to the final? And will that person become Britain’s Best Young Artist?</desc>

      <desc lang="en">The war in Ukraine is the biggest in Europe since World War II. Millions of children have been forced to leave their homes to escape the fighting, but many either others couldn’t or didn’t. Hearing from just some of those who are living through war, this film lets the children caught in the conflict tell their stories in their own words. Covering fear, loss, strength and hope, they detail the life-changing events of the war and the impact it is having on their day-to-day life. They share their experiences of surviving attacks from the air, being forced to live for weeks at a time in bomb shelters, and their towns and villages becoming occupied by Russian soldiers. Ricky Boleto finds out how the children are coping with living in a country at war.</desc>
