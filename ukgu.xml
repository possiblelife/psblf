These are explored through discovery, play, song and story. Grown-ups at home are encouraged to take part by hiding a safe, baby appropriate red toy or object inside a fabric bag or pillowcase for them to reveal and explore with their baby! The popular baby song Little Robin Redbreast features, as does a story involving Baby Bear and Baby Tiger, and viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring red things too.

Then, there’s a healthy eating quiz based on the food groups that make up a balanced diet. Finally, the teams must make their way across a giant inflatable version of the solar system. Can they get from Neptune to Mercury, stepping on every planet in the right order without getting knocked by the swinging stars?

It’s time to head back to the museum to see what Suzy and Archie make of it. Archie reveals that this object will ‘keep you safe and sound’, while Suzy finds a photo of a friend of hers with a big metal object just like the one Fred and Pete found. She sends them back to the beach to meet him. Fred and Pete arrive on the beach and are startled to see what looks like an alien with a metal object just like theirs, walking up to them. The ‘alien’ is actually Suzy's friend Iain, and he explains that the metal object on his head is a helmet for a very old-fashioned deep sea diving suit. Fred and Pete then wonder what divers do when they’re underwater. Suzy sends them to the other end of the beach to meet Hannah from the Cornish Diving Centre, who tells them about modern diving equipment and how they use it. Hannah invites Fred</desc>

First, they must match a sequence of colours given to them by mixing primary colours to make secondary colours. Then, in a game based on energy, they have to pedal bikes to power up lights and launch a rocket. Finally, the teams learn about structures by building arched bridges they can step across to reach an island. In the lab, Ayo is inspired by mathematician Katherine Johnson, who helped land the first person on the moon.

Archie the robot gives them a clue that the secret of their treasure can be found where people once dug underground. Connecting the two, Suzy sends Fred and Pete off to the tin mines. Jack, the manager of Geevor Tin Mine, gives Fred and Pete an underground tour and explains that tin was mined in Cornwall for thousands of years and used to make all sorts of objects. The boys show him their treasure which he identifies as a tin miner’s lunchbox. Jack points out that tin miners had very dirty hands, meaning they needed a special kind of lunch in their lunchbox. What could that be? Jack gives them a clue – the words ‘oggie, oggie, oggie!’ Suzy gets in contact via the Treasure Comm and explains that an oggie</desc>

Parents, carers and their babies at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! Inside Nigel’s bag are a toy pig, a toy sheep and a toy chicken, and all the parents and babies have different objects and toys that are themed around things you might find at a farm. These are explored through discovery, play, song and story. Grown-ups at home are encouraged to take part by hiding safe, baby-appropriate farm objects and toys inside a fabric bag or pillowcase for them to reveal and explore with their baby! The fun song Old MacDonald Had A Farm features, as does a story involving Baby Bear, and viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring farm things too. The Together Song gets everyone moving about before some calm time with sensory scarves and the Goodbye Song.</desc>

Suzy sends the boys off to a fishmonger, where Kay points out that the horn is a huer’s horn used to helped fishermen find fish. But how could blowing a horn help anyone find fish? Suzy rings on the Treasure Comm and directs Fred and Pete to visit a huer’s hut on the cliffs above Newquay. There, they meet Karl, who explains that the horn was blown to indicate that the huer had seen some fish. Karl then shows Fred and Pete how the huer would use signals to get the fishing fleet into position. Fred and Pete decide to put this to the test. Unfortunately, the wind and a swarm of bees play havoc with Pete’s directions, but Fred somehow ends up back in the fishmonger, where he buys some Cornish sardines. Suzy ring</desc>

Having already been patched up 65-years previously when he first got the bike, Peter is hoping an expert can bring it back to life. Betty brings in a battered leather briefcase given to her as a gift for passing her engineering qualification. After spending 65 years using the briefcase while working as the first ever female member of the Institute for Structural Engineers, Betty is hoping master saddlemaker Suzie Fletcher can restore the case to its former glory. Steve Fletcher uses his expertise to repair an old clocking-on machine from the British Rail depot in Crewe but the job takes an unexpected turn when he discovers a mystery cog with no obvious place in the mechanism</desc>
