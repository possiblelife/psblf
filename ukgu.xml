The original investigation concluded Gibson's death was probably suicide due to his dire financial situation, but the detectives have some questions about the pub's live-in barmaid, who disappeared on the night of the blaze. Could widowed landlady Joanne, pub regular Jason, or the dead man's best friend David, who happens to have a sideline in passing off his British-produced sparkling wine as French champagne, supply them with any answers?

    <title lang="en">Killing Me Softly: The Roberta Flack Story</title>
      <desc lang="en">A documentary profile of the American singer, best known for her early 1970s hits such as The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, Where Is the Love and Killing Me Softly with His Song. The programme documents her middle class upbringing, born out of the self-contained hub of a segregated country, and her relative late breakthrough, occurring in her mid thirties. As a solo and duet artist she had her detractors for adapting her style to white traditions, but eventually won over a nation with her soft, gentle tones. Contributors include Dionne Warwick, Johnny Mathis and Cissy Houston, as well as several reflections from Flack herself</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Russia is supplying the Myanmar military with advanced fighter jets and training their pilots how to use them in a war against their own people. More than two years on from the coup, the country's military is facing a countrywide armed uprising and their troops are struggling to hold ground and recruit foot soldiers. So, the strategy is turning increasingly to the air with devastating consequences. BBC's Asia editor Rebecca Henschke follows those fighting back on the ground and in the air. And she meets defectors from the air force who give exclusive insight into the strategy and psychology behind those operating these deadly machines.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">AJ Odudu presents the final of this contest, in which up-and-coming interior designers battle it out to make over - and ultimately win - an apartment of their own, worth £250,000. Judge Dara Huang believes that a hallway is one of the hardest areas to get right - it needs to be practical and welcoming and also set the tone for the rest of the home. She's looking to the finalists to engineer transformations that say something about each of then persoanlly, and wants to see creativity packed into these challenging spaces</desc>

Crisp sets off on the journey of a lifetime to the Big Apple, where the Americans immediately embrace the openly gay writer and his waspish ways, and before long he is being wined and dined by celebrities in every corner of Manhattan. But, as is so often the case with Quentin, he cannot resist making outrageous comments, and an ill-considered quip about the growing Aids crisis sees him suddenly dropped from high society.
