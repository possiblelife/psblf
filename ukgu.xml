Over the course of a year, we discover what it is like to live as part of a close family and community in a tiny traditional Cornish coastal village. We see how Jamie’s life is impacted by the ebb and flow of the seasons as the tourists come and go, and the winter storms roll in stopping the boats from heading out. He continues to learn the family business and explore what the future might hold for the next generation of Cornish fishermen. Will Jamie keep his heart set on the sea and a life as one of the sons of Cadgwith Cove?</desc>

The What's in the Box? game reveals a soft toy tree, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are all about trees. This theme is explored through exploration, play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate tree object inside a recycled box, for them to reveal and explore with their toddler! Storytime is all about joining in with physical actions, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear plants some seeds to grow a tree. They have to dig a hole and use a watering can! Viewers at home show how they've been exploring the tree theme too. Plus, the Toddler Club Bop gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with stretching and the Goodbye song.</desc>

This is found to have been used to shoot footage of land surrounding several military bases and it becomes clear Griggs was apparently looking for evidence that someone did not want to be discovered.
