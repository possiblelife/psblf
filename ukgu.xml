Determined to tell people everywhere about their home town, the boys have come together to write a new song all about the heroes in Mathare and the struggles they face every day. They travel around town to record their new song, attend a music workshop with their friends, perform their new song for the first time in front of a big audience, and even see amazing wildlife in Nairobi National Park. Their dream is to have the song heard by people outside of Nairobi - but will they manage to get it played on one of Africa's most famous radio stations?</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Join Maddie as she finds out about the exciting things people do to train to become an astronaut. Maddie explains the different layers of our atmosphere and how astronauts travel through it into space and the special suits they wear to protect them. She tries on a real spacesuit and learns about the types of spacesuits they wear to do different jobs. Maddie discovers astronauts need to be fit, healthy and have good agility. She finds out how they learn how to move in space when they can’t keep their feet on the ground! We discover there is less gravity in space than on Earth and although astronauts look like they are floating, they are free falling.</desc>

Finally, Gino rustles up one of Liguria's most popular dishes - trofie pasta with rustic pesto, green beans and potato</desc>
