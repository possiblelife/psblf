      <desc lang="en">The oil palm is a remarkable tree, with an incredibly diverse fruit that can be used for many different things - from shampoo and soap to toothpaste, crisps and chocolate. Unfortunately, the spread of this remarkable plant is leading to the destruction of the rainforests, particularly in Borneo and Sumatra. So what can we do? Firstly, learn where your food is coming from. Pay attention to the labels and look out for sustainable palm oil. We can’t get rid of palm oil altogether as it is in countless products, and many of the alternatives would be worse.

Gail’s team turn to the Crystal Ball for help. In Nana’s Panto Showdown, Nana Knickerbocker and her cows are busy making pizzas. After the Crystal Ball refuses to help, Gail’s team are still yet to score a gigglepoint at the halfway point in the show. Round 3 features a clip starring King Flannel trying to get a biscuit. After some more refusal from the Crystal Ball, Wizard Tripwick and Gail struggle to answer the questions themselves. Keith produces his own crystal football to help his team with the answers. After saying goodbye to the Crystal Ball and totting up the final scores, the winners of this GiggleQuiz are revealed.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Elder Panda is teaching Love Monster to fly a kite. Love Monster loves to watch it swish around in the air. Elder Panda goes off to get some froyo, which is perfect on Kite Day. Before he goes, he tells Love Monster that soon it will be time for him to go on to his next kiting challenge. Love Monster looks at all the other kites and sees the dragon kite, which is the largest kite of them all. Love Monster’s small kite doesn’t seem that exciting any more. He decides to try the dragon kite for just a minute. At first it seems easy, but then a wind gets it tangled in a tree. The rope breaks, and the kite flies off, causing mayhem in Fluffytown with everyone thinking it is a real dragon invasion. Finally, Elder Panda arrives and manages to bring it down to the ground using an umbrella, and Love Monster comes clean, saying how sorry he is. Elder Panda is disappointed but he does understand, as he too wanted to fly before he could run, but sometimes you have to start small before going big.</desc>
