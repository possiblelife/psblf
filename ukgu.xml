Rory and Sandy head deep into the forest to try and find some red squirrels, whilst Chantelle heads offshore to an island to meet a local expert who has been studying them in the wild. Chantelle and Rory’s fact files help answer all of Alistair’s questions. With the help of the Teeny Tiny Creatures poem, we discover that, like lots of other teeny tiny creatures, red squirrels are superheroes and help our planet in their own special way. In the Teeny Tiny Task, Rory shows Sandy what it might feel like to be a red squirrel as he jumps around in the treetops.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Anton &amp; Giovanni's Adventures in Sicily</title>
      <desc lang="en">The second leg of their trip takes Anton and Giovanni to Mount Etna, Europe's highest and most active volcano. Along the way Giovanni takes Anton to a traditional Sicilian barber to get beach ready before trying paddleboarding in the Ionian Sea. When they reach the volcano, the pair hike halfway to the summit with some help from some unexpected furry friends before deciding to camp overnight. A surprise visit from 2021 Strictly champion Rose Ayling-Ellis wakes them up and they complete their trek in style by taking to the skies and flying over the crater in a helicopter</desc>
