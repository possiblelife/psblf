      <desc lang="en">Italy v Wales (Kick-off 2.15pm). Jill Douglas presents coverage of both teams' fourth match of the championship, held at Stadio Olimpico. Warren Gatland's side come into this game in desperate need of a morale boosting victory after a turbulent few weeks for Welsh rugby, but they are going up against an Italy side who claimed a historic win against them last year in Cardiff thanks to a late Edoardo Padovani try at the Principality Stadium. Despite losing all of their matches so far, the Azzurri have shown significant signs of improvement and they will be targeting a first home win in this competition since 2013.

The French's hopes of a second successive Grand Slam came to an end when they were defeated by Ireland in round two, but wins over the Italians and Scots either side of that setback mean that, like their opponents, they are still in title contention should the Irish slip up.
