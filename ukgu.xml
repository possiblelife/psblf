      <desc lang="en">The war in Ukraine is the biggest in Europe since World War II. Millions of children have been forced to leave their homes to escape the fighting, but many either others couldn’t or didn’t. Hearing from just some of those who are living through war, this film lets the children caught in the conflict tell their stories in their own words. Covering fear, loss, strength and hope, they detail the life-changing events of the war and the impact it is having on their day-to-day life. They share their experiences of surviving attacks from the air, being forced to live for weeks at a time in bomb shelters, and their towns and villages becoming occupied by Russian soldiers. Ricky Boleto finds out how the children are coping with living in a country at war.</desc>

Roy isn't the only family member having trouble parting with their old, unused items. Bill becomes incredibly attached to some old tight fitting clothes, and there's a scarf Maura has her eye on too. Mr Barker is just as reluctant as Roy, and when Mrs Barker is about to catch them both hiding out in Reg's shed, Roy wonders what Wonder Roy would do? Wonder Roy loses his brand new cape in a villainous encounter with The Messer and Glitterella. He had given Finn his old cape ­ much to Finn's delight, and is reluctant to take it back, but Finn reassures him that who we are is much more important than the things we own.

Before he goes, he tells Love Monster that soon it will be time for him to go on to his next kiting challenge. Love Monster looks at all the other kites and sees the dragon kite, which is the largest kite of them all. Love Monster’s small kite doesn’t seem that exciting any more. He decides to try the dragon kite for just a minute. At first it seems easy, but then a wind gets it tangled in a tree. The rope breaks, and the kite flies off, causing mayhem in Fluffytown with everyone thinking it is a real dragon invasion. Finally, Elder Panda arrives and manages to bring it down to the ground using an umbrella, and Love Monster comes clean, saying how sorry he is. Elder Panda is disappointed but he does understand, as he too wanted to fly before he could run, but sometimes you have to start small before going big.</desc>

The What’s in the Box? game reveals a wooden triangle toy, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are inspired by shapes. This theme is explored through play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate shapes toy or object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about discovering new words, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear look for lots of different shapes at home and when they’re out and about. Viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring the shapes theme too. Plus, The Circle Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with stretching and the Goodbye song.</desc>

But when Chip begins to suspect that Angel isn’t as angelic as she seems, he must find a way to clear Floppy’s name and catch Angel in the act.</desc>

This theme is explored through play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate feelings toy or object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler! Storytime is all about discovering new words, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear have a party and invite their friends. But what feelings will they have once everyone arrives and the party starts?

Lars loves these tough little birds and explains how, although they spend most of their lives flying out to sea and fishing, they return to land each year to lay their eggs. When the baby birds, also called pufflings, eventually hatch, they fly out towards the ocean. But the light from nearby towns often confuses them about where to go, leading local children and adults to form 'puffin patrols' to rescue the pufflings. Lars is excited to help out but is upset when he discovers Glitch, also a fan of puffins, is already well-known on the islands for his skills as a puffin rescuer. Although Glitch offers him a place in his puffin patrol, Lars is determined to outdo Glitch with a patrol of his own - but when he recruits a clumsy Grimbot, things take a turn for the worse...</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Tinks is a disability assistance dog for her owner, Charli, who has a condition that makes it painful for her to pick things up or to push and pull things. Tinks uses her superfetch skills to help Charli every day. The smallest of the Dog Squad gang, Tinks is a little Lhasa Apso with lots of big dog energy. Tinks and Charli are planting some seeds at the allotments. Tinks chats to her gardening friends the gnomes and braves the big dark shed to find Charli’s gardening gloves, before choosing some sunflower seeds and helping Charli to plant them. But when Charli sends Tinks on a mission to find the watering can, it turns out to be empty. The allotments are a big place for a little dog. Can Tinks find someone to help her and Charli water their seeds? Just wait until the rest of Dog Squad hear about their sunflower adventure!</desc>
