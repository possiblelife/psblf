Love Monster looks at all the other kites and sees the dragon kite, which is the largest kite of them all. Love Monster’s small kite doesn’t seem that exciting any more. He decides to try the dragon kite for just a minute. At first it seems easy, but then a wind gets it tangled in a tree. The rope breaks, and the kite flies off, causing mayhem in Fluffytown with everyone thinking it is a real dragon invasion. Finally, Elder Panda arrives and manages to bring it down to the ground using an umbrella, and Love Monster comes clean, saying how sorry he is. Elder Panda is disappointed but he does understand, as he too wanted to fly before he could run, but sometimes you have to start small before going big.</desc>

It won’t be long before Moira hears them, and there are no pets allowed in the Big Hub. Mack and Bob need to find a way to keep the fluffy chicks quiet before Moira finds out. Bob manages to stop Moira hearing the chicks for a while with help from Mack, Daisy, Molly and Suki, but it isn’t long before the game is up.</desc>

Lola begins by rolling out two pieces of pizza dough into big circles. She cooks one in the oven. Lola adds tomato puree to passata to make the filling. She also adds some canned tuna, green olives, and boiled egg. She seasons the mixture with paprika, black pepper and her special ingredient, oregano. Then Lola spreads the filling over the dough, which has been in the oven. She finishes the recipe by adding the last piece of dough on top and then putting it back in the oven to cook. Will Lola's friends find the empanadas tasty? Will they guess her special ingredient? There's a very exciting Spanish surprise waiting for her friends while they enjoy their meal!</desc>

In this edition, Michaela is in the Maldives, which is facing an existential challenge from global warming - its picture-postcard sand islands are literally being washed from the map.

Coral reefs are key to protecting the islands from storms and surges, but as the oceans warm, they are being killed off by coral bleaching. Scientists in the Maldives are trying different techniques to resurrect the reefs, from the use of electricity to promote growth to the search for more resilient species.
