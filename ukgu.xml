It’s time to head back to the museum to see what Suzy and Archie make of it. Archie reveals that this object will ‘keep you safe and sound’, while Suzy finds a photo of a friend of hers with a big metal object just like the one Fred and Pete found. She sends them back to the beach to meet him. Fred and Pete arrive on the beach and are startled to see what looks like an alien with a metal object just like theirs, walking up to them.
