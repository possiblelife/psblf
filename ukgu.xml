      <desc lang="en">Gemma, Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear welcome toddlers Elena, Cavalli, Betsy and Brodhi, and their grown-ups to the Toddler Club. Parents, carers and their little ones at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! The What's in the Box? game reveals a plastic knife, fork and spoon, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are all inspired by the phrase 'let's eat'. This theme is explored through exploration, play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate 'let's eat' object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about joining in with physical actions, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear help Big Bear to make a tasty apple pie! Viewers at home show how they've been exploring the 'let's eat' theme too. Plus, the Big Band Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with stretching and the Goodbye song</desc>

      <desc lang="en">The war in Ukraine is the biggest in Europe since World War II. Millions of children have been forced to leave their homes to escape the fighting, but many either others couldn’t or didn’t. Hearing from just some of those who are living through war, this film lets the children caught in the conflict tell their stories in their own words. Covering fear, loss, strength and hope, they detail the life-changing events of the war and the impact it is having on their day-to-day life. They share their experiences of surviving attacks from the air, being forced to live for weeks at a time in bomb shelters, and their towns and villages becoming occupied by Russian soldiers. Ricky Boleto finds out how the children are coping with living in a country at war.</desc>
