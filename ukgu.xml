      <desc lang="en">When the Globe's new owner Archibald Frost threatens to knock down the theatre to build a skyscraper, William Shakespeare and his players spring into action to convince him that plays are fun by staging As You Like It. The story begins with two brothers: kind Orlando and mean Oliver. Oliver refuses to share any of their father's money with Orlando. Shakespeare introduces two more bickering brothers: nasty Duke Frederick and friendly Duke Senior. Duke Frederick is so nasty that he banishes Duke Senior from court for no reason other than being nicer than him. Frost meets cousins Rosalind and Celia; Rosalind is sad because her father Duke Senior has been banished. Celia tries to cheer up Rosalind, and together they talk about falling in love. Children's drama, starring Andy Day and Justin Fletcher</desc>

The women of Cranford are excited about the imminent visit of Lady Glenmire, until the Hon Mrs Jamieson announces that none of them is of high enough social standing to meet her - so Miss Matty leads the Amazons in snubbing both the newcomer and her hostess. But sociable Lady Glenmire is quick to offer an olive branch by hosting a memorable Halloween party, which results in the forging of new friendships. Mr Buxton is impressed by Edward Bell's ambitions, so takes him on as land agent, only for the new employee to make a disastrous decision that has dire consequences for both himself and his sister Peggy. Meanwhile, Matty is distressed when a surprising discovery about one of her close circle results in a serious falling out among the friends, and when tragedy strikes the town, she fears Cranford may never recover.
