      <desc lang="en">Alan Titchmarsh and his team share their favourite money-saving gardening tips, creating classic garden features that are big on impact and easy on the pocket. With the average cost of a full garden makeover now believed to be between seven and ten thousand pounds, Katie Rushworth and David Domoney come to the aid of two families of garden novices, who only half that amount to spend. Taking totally different approaches and encouraging the garden owners to get stuck in, they will try and help them build their dream garden without going over the three and half thousand-pound budget. Will the owners be impressed by the money saving makeovers?</desc>
