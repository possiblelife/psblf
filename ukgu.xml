Love Monster looks at all the other kites and sees the dragon kite, which is the largest kite of them all. Love Monster’s small kite doesn’t seem that exciting any more. He decides to try the dragon kite for just a minute. At first it seems easy, but then a wind gets it tangled in a tree. The rope breaks, and the kite flies off, causing mayhem in Fluffytown with everyone thinking it is a real dragon invasion. Finally, Elder Panda arrives and manages to bring it down to the ground using an umbrella, and Love Monster comes clean, saying how sorry he is. Elder Panda is disappointed but he does understand, as he too wanted to fly before he could run, but sometimes you have to start small before going big.</desc>

Bob is fixing Moira’s new vacuum cleaner, but unfortunately the instructions are in French and he can’t make sense of them. When Mrs Juniper arrives, Bob and Mack discover she has a hidden talent – she can speak French. Mack wonders if he has a hidden talent, and Bob reminds him he does - for sneaky sneaking. Mack remembers Bob has a talent for being a great ‘dada’ to his fluffy chicks. When Molly and James arrive at the Hub, they recall Alice’s gift for practical jokes. Then Moira stops by and they all cast their minds back to the time she showed off her flair for roller skating – even though she’d forgotten how to stop. By the time Bob fixes Moira’s vacuum cleaner, we find out that everyone in the Hub has a special hidden talent.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">AJ Odudu presents the final of this contest, in which up-and-coming interior designers battle it out to make over - and ultimately win - an apartment of their own, worth £250,000. Judge Dara Huang believes that a hallway is one of the hardest areas to get right - it needs to be practical and welcoming and also set the tone for the rest of the home. She's looking to the finalists to engineer transformations that say something about each of then persoanlly, and wants to see creativity packed into these challenging spaces</desc>
