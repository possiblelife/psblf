The crowd is stunned into silence. Love Monster is horrified at what he has done and immediately says sorry. He explains that he wants everyone to cheer for him like they cheer for Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny. She admits it did feel good and tingly inside when everyone was cheering for her, but she says that everyone has something they are good at and Love Monster is the best beatboxer in Fluffytown. Love Monster realises that she is right and starts beatboxing. The Fluffytowners start having fun again and begin cheering for him.</desc>

Bob and Ted tell them how they used to pretend to be one another when they were boys. This gives Molly an idea! Bob and Ted could play the same trick again, on everyone in the Hub. Soon, Molly and Bob are up on the balcony watching Ted pretending to be Bob at his stall. At first, the plan goes well, but things soon start to go wrong. Ted gets everyone’s names mixed up and he doesn’t know his plums from his apricots. Finally, when Moira asks ‘Bob’ to fix her spinny chair, we discover that Ted is a bit useless at mending things, and the game is most definitely up!</desc>
