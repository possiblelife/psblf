She then wraps the potato mixture around her special ingredient, hard-boiled eggs, rolls them in breadcrumbs and puts them in the oven to be cooked. Zahra-Rose also serves a fresh chilli sauce, so her friends can use it for dipping. Not only does Zahra-Rose have beautiful decorations, she also has a surprise picnic planned.
