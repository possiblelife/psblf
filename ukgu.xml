    <title lang="en">Immortal Egypt with Joann Fletcher</title>
      <desc lang="en">Joann explores the peak of ancient Egyptian civilisation by looking at the Colossi of Memnon, two massive stone statues depicting Pharaoh Amenhotep III, and examining the lives of the workers and artisans involved in the building of the Valley of the Kings. This golden age was threatened by the growing power of Karnak's priests, and Joann reveals how Tutankhamen's early death was a chance for Egypt to start afresh and rewrite history, but was undermined by decades of state-sanctioned looting of the tombs</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Following his selection for the GB squad, artistic gymnast Winston is heading off to Germany with his team-mates for an international competition where they will be up against some of the world’s major players. Even though his team are there to support him, he has to face his fear and take on the pommel, the apparatus that has caused him more than his fair share of problems during the last season. The boys also face the distraction of a trip to an out-of-this-world car museum - but will Winston be able to hold it together when the team comes up against some of the world’s best gymnasts from the USA and France. Back in Birmingham, the display girls get to grips with a new routine in preparation for a performance in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games. Coach Lisa has given the girls a new challenge – not only do they have to perfect their routine, but they also have to choreograph part of it themselves.</desc>

Suzy sends the boys off to a fishmonger, where Kay points out that the horn is a huer’s horn used to helped fishermen find fish. But how could blowing a horn help anyone find fish? Suzy rings on the Treasure Comm and directs Fred and Pete to visit a huer’s hut on the cliffs above Newquay.

Karl then shows Fred and Pete how the huer would use signals to get the fishing fleet into position. Fred and Pete decide to put this to the test. Unfortunately, the wind and a swarm of bees play havoc with Pete’s directions, but Fred somehow ends up back in the fishmonger, where he buys some Cornish sardines. Suzy ring</desc>

Lola begins by rolling out two pieces of pizza dough into big circles. She cooks one in the oven. Lola adds tomato puree to passata to make the filling. She also adds some canned tuna, green olives, and boiled egg. She seasons the mixture with paprika, black pepper and her special ingredient, oregano. Then Lola spreads the filling over the dough, which has been in the oven. She finishes the recipe by adding the last piece of dough on top and then putting it back in the oven to cook. Will Lola's friends find the empanadas tasty? Will they guess her special ingredient? There's a very exciting Spanish surprise waiting for her friends while they enjoy their meal!</desc>

After many failed guesses, they decide to take the metal blob to the museum. Suzy and Archie recognise that the metal blob is made of bronze, an important metal in early Cornish history. Thousands of years ago, bronze was used to make tools all over the county during a period called the Bronze Age. They meet archaeologist James, who explains how the discovery of bronze allowed people to make tools that were stronger and faster than the stone tools used before. Suzy rings them on the Treasure Comm to tell them how Bronze Age people used to live in what are called round houses. She sends them to one nearby to find out exactly what life was like back then. After changing into some Bronze Age clothing, Fred and Pete check out the round house and discover that Bronze Age people were kept very busy with simple, everyday tasks </desc>

      <desc lang="en">Russia is supplying the Myanmar military with advanced fighter jets and training their pilots how to use them in a war against their own people. More than two years on from the coup, the country's military is facing a countrywide armed uprising and their troops are struggling to hold ground and recruit foot soldiers. So, the strategy is turning increasingly to the air with devastating consequences. BBC's Asia editor Rebecca Henschke follows those fighting back on the ground and in the air. And she meets defectors from the air force who give exclusive insight into the strategy and psychology behind those operating these deadly machines.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Russia is supplying the Myanmar military with advanced fighter jets and training their pilots how to use them in a war against their own people. More than two years on from the coup, the country's military is facing a countrywide armed uprising and their troops are struggling to hold ground and recruit foot soldiers. So, the strategy is turning increasingly to the air with devastating consequences. BBC's Asia editor Rebecca Henschke follows those fighting back on the ground and in the air. And she meets defectors from the air force who give exclusive insight into the strategy and psychology behind those operating these deadly machines.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Once dubbed the 'murder capital' of the world, for nearly three decades, rival gangs ruled the streets of El Salvador through a regime of violence, extortion and fear. That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>
