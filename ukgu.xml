He sets off on a 10,000-mile journey from the west to the east, to explore the vast swathe of islands that are scattered beyond America's shores. The first port of call on his journey is Hawaii, and his exploration looks beyond its image as a tourist paradise, crammed with sun-kissed beaches and world-class surfing, and into the havoc wreaked by advancing lava fields and smoking craters. Leaving Hawaii, Martin flies 2,500 miles north to the islands of Alaska, where the contrast couldn't be more extreme, from tropical rain forests to snow-fringed glaciers, and from crowded beaches to some of America's most sparsely populated territories</desc>

He sets off on a 10,000-mile journey from the west to the east, to explore the vast swathe of islands that are scattered beyond America's shores. The first port of call on his journey is Hawaii, and his exploration looks beyond its image as a tourist paradise, crammed with sun-kissed beaches and world-class surfing, and into the havoc wreaked by advancing lava fields and smoking craters. Leaving Hawaii, Martin flies 2,500 miles north to the islands of Alaska, where the contrast couldn't be more extreme, from tropical rain forests to snow-fringed glaciers, and from crowded beaches to some of America's most sparsely populated territories</desc>

In 2020, Kirstie and Phil met Elliot and James who were looking to find a home they could share with four bedrooms and an open plan entertaining space in London.

      <desc lang="en">Sandi is joined by Eddie Izzard on an Irish adventure as they visit three holiday hideaways in Counties Clare, Kerry and Cork and bond over homemade apple crumble. Their first stop in County Clare is a miniature modern marvel called Teeroneer, a timber-clad, prize-winning property with a sunken kitchen that Sandi just can't resist cooking in. From there the pair head to Ark Ranch Treehouse. Hand-built by one woman, Sandi and Eddie are charmed by the sense of childhood adventure they feel. Finally, they head to Lost Cottage in the mountains and lakes of County Kerry. A classic fusion of old and new, the remote rental gives the pair an excuse for Sandi to take Eddie on her very first fishing trip</desc>
