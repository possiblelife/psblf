She starts the timer, and everyone hurries off to their nap stations to begin their naps. As the other Fluffytowners start to doze off, Love Monster struggles to fall asleep. After trying a pre-nap workout with Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny, practising yoga with Book Cub and pillow drumming with Bad Idea Puppy, a frustrated Love Monster gives up and thinks he might as well start getting ready for the party. He heads over to his decks and puts on a song just before the sleep timer goes off, and everyone awakes full of energy.

He then adds garlic puree, ginger puree, chutney and chopped tomatoes to cooked beef mince. Sebastiaan then carefully makes powder out of his special ingredient, cumin seeds, and adds the powder to the beef mixture. Sebastiaan mixes both the vegetables and the beef in an oven dish and flattens them before adding two bay leaves. He adds a topping of milk and egg and then places it in the oven. Sebastiaan has a wonderfully decorated table, and he has another traditional treat to go with his bobotie. Will his friends figure out what his special ingredient is?</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Leo's family is from Russia, and they have shown him how to make a special sharlotka, a simple Russian apple cake. Leo starts by separating the eggs. He then adds sugar and flour to the yolks and mixes them together until the mixture is smooth. He whisks the egg whites until they are stiff and stirs them into the yolk mix. After this, Leo cuts apples into small chunks and places half of them in a cake tin, pours over the egg mixture and puts the rest of the apples on top. Then the sharlotka is ready to be baked in the oven. Leo even has an extra special Russian-themed surprise for his friends while they eat! Can they work out what his special ingredient is?</desc>
