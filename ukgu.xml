The What's in the Box? game reveals a ball, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are all about sports. This theme is explored through exploration, play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate sports object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about joining in with physical actions, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear have a pretend sports day. The twins find lots of ways to help them jump, run, climb and balance. Viewers at home show how they've been exploring the sports theme too. Plus, the Toddler Club Bop gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with stretching and the </desc>

Discover how trees grow, how we can tell the age of trees and how the roots, leaves and bark work. Maddie shows how trees are home to lots of other plants, animals, birds and insects who live on and amongst them and have an important role in our ecosystem. We’ll discover a tree’s leaves make energy using sunlight, so they can keep growing. We learn that a tree is alive, it drinks and breathes and grows just like we do! And we’ll find out about deciduous trees that lose their leaves in winter and evergreens that keep their leaves all year round.</desc>

He becomes so frustrated that he kicks a beanbag and it hurtles towards the scoreboard, knocking all the points to the ground, ripping the bunting and giving Delivery Duckling, Elder Chick, Elder Panda and the In-Chicks a fright. The crowd is stunned into silence. Love Monster is horrified at what he has done and immediately says sorry. He explains that he wants everyone to cheer for him like they cheer for Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny. She admits it did feel good and tingly inside when everyone was cheering for her, but she says that everyone has something they are good at and Love Monster is the best beatboxer in Fluffytown. Love Monster realises that she is right and starts beatboxing. The Fluffytowners start having fun again and begin cheering for him.</desc>

First, the teams must guess which animals Sam and Ayo are looking at through their telescope based on a series of clues. Then the teams must work out which season James is talking about by standing under the correct tree. If they’re correct, they’ll get covered in spring blossom, summer sunlight, autumn leaves or winter snow. Finally, the teams learn about structures by building arched bridges that they can step across to reach an island. Meanwhile, Ayo and Sam are packing for a mission in the space capsule, but they can’t carry more than 2.5kg. Can they work out what to take so that their packs aren’t too heavy?</desc>
