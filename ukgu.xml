Meanwhile, the third pays homage to Desperate Dan and his favourite food of cow pie in a refined beef cheek pie with onion crumb puff pastry and glazed vegetables.

Our 'buy and throw away' culture contributes to the global warming crisis so something has to be done. In a vivid animated world, we learn about the journey that many of our clothes make; from where they are manufactured, all the way to how they are transported to the UK high streets - but are there other alternatives when buying our clothes? Anita sets out to explore sustainable solutions for young people. She talks to environmentalist Zaqiya about her school initiative, Swop it Up, and Holly, manager of the UK's largest charity shop. Together they show us ways young people can buy fashionable clothes and look after the planet at the same time.</desc>

Today, it’s the third and last semi-final in which three of the artists who made it through have to create a piece for our celebrity commissioner, Dr Ronx. For their masterpiece they must make a work of art based on the theme of community. Before they do that though they pay a visit to Ronx’s hometown of London. There they help out at a community centre and learn more about their commissioner. They then return to the Art Studio to create their artworks in 2 hour and 30 minutes. But who will Ricky and Sadie pick to go through to the final? And will that person become Britain’s Best Young Artist?</desc>

Lars loves these tough little birds and explains how, although they spend most of their lives flying out to sea and fishing, they return to land each year to lay their eggs. When the baby birds, also called pufflings, eventually hatch, they fly out towards the ocean. But the light from nearby towns often confuses them about where to go, leading local children and adults to form 'puffin patrols' to rescue the pufflings. Lars is excited to help out but is upset when he discovers Glitch, also a fan of puffins, is already well-known on the islands for his skills as a puffin rescuer. Although Glitch offers him a place in his puffin patrol, Lars is determined to outdo Glitch with a patrol of his own - but when he recruits a clumsy Grimbot, things take a turn for the worse...</desc>

At school, Mollie gets the chance to learn about traditional Welsh dress while practicing her Welsh phrases. Some very special school visitors arrive to bring on fun games and songs to sing. After a short stop off at Nana's house, where they make delicious Welsh cakes together, Mollie and her family head over to a local workshop. They get the chance to design their very own lovespoon and watch it actually being made! Before the day is done, it's time to catch the St David's Day festival in Swansea.

He uses his superhearing to zoom in on the important sounds like the pet shop door bell. Diesel helps Rayane find the pet food aisle, where he chooses his pet food and a new toy, while being careful to choose one without a squeaker. Squeakers are for training time, not playtime. But then there’s an emergency at the cafe when the smoke alarm goes off, and the cafe has to be evacuated.

      <desc lang="en">The Go Jetters face their toughest mission yet: organising a birthday party for Ubercorn without him finding out! Luckily, when Glitch and Ubercorn were cadets together, they made a map of all the secret passages around the Academy. The Go Jetters can use it to avoid detection while they prepare the party. Xuli and Lars take a secret tunnel to the arts and craft room to make the decorations, while Foz, Kyan and Glitch head out into the Academy garden to gather Ubercorn’s favourite flowers, cherry blossoms. But things don't go according to plan, and the Go Jetters have to hide themselves to avoid a wandering Ubercorn.</desc>

This theme is explored through exploration, play, song and story.

Storytime is all about discovering new words, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear help Big Bear to look after Baby Bear. The twins help change, feed and bath Baby Bear. Viewers at home show how they've been exploring the babies theme too. Plus, the Benjee and Bailee Say Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with stretchin</desc>

James defends the honour of the car in a very small Renault, Richard tries to prove that pedalling is faster by riding a bicycle, while Jeremy attempts to demonstrate that water is the quickest way across town by piloting a hovercraft. To make matters more complicated, all three presenters are racing not only one another but also the Stig, who is making his way toward the finish line by public transport. Plus, the new Lamborghini Huracan is put through its paces and singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran takes to the test track in the Reasonably Priced Car</desc>

      <desc lang="en">The police wake to the news of a robbery, but the full extent of the crime and its haul - £2.6million - only becomes evident over the following days. It's clear the local CID is ill-equipped to solve a case of such magnitude, so Scotland Yard is called in, with a six-strong team of detectives headed by the Flying Squad's enigmatic chief Tommy Butler. In a race against time, they set out to identify every criminal involved and bring them to justice before they flee the country - but even if they can, will they find the money? Jim Broadbent stars in the concluding part of the drama about the most infamous heist in British history, with George Costigan, Robert Glenister, Tim Pigott-Smith, Nick Moran and John Salthouse.
