      <desc lang="en">First in a two-part special. The story picks up in August 1844, two years after Miss Matty lost her beloved sister Deborah. Mr Buxton has returned to live quietly in Cranford following the death of his wife, although Miss Matty is concerned about his relationship with his son as neither seem to be coping with their bereavement. The local busybody is also worried about Peggy Bell, who lives in an isolated cottage looking after her inattentive mother and domineering brother, so she hatches a plot to bring these young residents together. However, the surprise arrival of Lady Ludlow's son Lord Septimus leads to a chain of unexpected events concerning the looming railway, and a tragedy at Matty's own house forces her to re-evaluate her opinions on the subject.

The women of Cranford are excited about the imminent visit of Lady Glenmire, until the Hon Mrs Jamieson announces that none of them is of high enough social standing to meet her - so Miss Matty leads the Amazons in snubbing both the newcomer and her hostess. But sociable Lady Glenmire is quick to offer an olive branch by hosting a memorable Halloween party, which results in the forging of new friendships. Mr Buxton is impressed by Edward Bell's ambitions, so takes him on as land agent, only for the new employee to make a disastrous decision that has dire consequences for both himself and his sister Peggy. Meanwhile, Matty is distressed when a surprising discovery about one of her close circle results in a serious falling out among the friends, and when tragedy strikes the town, she fears Cranford may never recover.

First, they must match a sequence of colours given to them by mixing primary colours to make secondary colours. Then, in a game based on energy, they have to pedal bikes to power up lights and launch a rocket. Finally, the teams learn about structures by building arched bridges they can step across to reach an island. In the lab, Ayo is inspired by mathematician Katherine Johnson, who helped land the first person on the moon. Ayo helps Sam realise maths is all around us in everything we do – from cooking to shopping and sport!</desc>

Febo adds his special ingredient, pumpkin puree, and then mixes them all together. When it's mixed, he spoons it into the empty pastry case and puts it in the oven to cook.

      <desc lang="en">It is 1933 and Adolf Hitler is the chancellor of Germany, but he does not have absolute power as there is still a democratic parliament, a head of state and the rule of law. Hitler calls a general election to increase Nazi representation, but a fire in the Reichstag building is blamed on communists - prompting thousands of arrests of left-wingers. Hitler then calls on President von Hindenburg to act and a decree is passed giving the Nazis emergency powers to ban free speech and the right to protest</desc>

The most well-known of these was Ernst Roehm, commander and co-founder of the Sturmabteilung, the Nazi Party's militia, whom Hitler had come to see as a potential rival. At least 85 people died during the purge, although the final death toll may have been in the hundreds</desc>
