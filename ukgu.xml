Rufus is appointed Ollie’s ineffective lawyer. (His amenability is something his girlfriend Kat finds very frustrating). Lily is Martha’s disappointing lawyer - whilst promising an epic opening statement, Lily makes it all about Rob being in America. Ollie asks Martha to prove she can throw a hoop on target. Martha objects, but Judge Kat insists that it will be amusing to witness Martha throw hoops. Martha applies the scientific calculations she gave to Ollie to help him win Edison, but she still fails to throw a hoop successfully. Ollie nears victory when the court adjourns because Mr Malone is hungry. Later, whilst Rufus admits to Kat that he doesn’t feel he is cut out to be a lawyer, he offers Kat the largest slice of cake even though he wants it. This infuriates Kat. She tells Rufus that he needs to be less easy-goi</desc>

Even though his team are there to support him, he has to face his fear and take on the pommel, the apparatus that has caused him more than his fair share of problems during the last season. The boys also face the distraction of a trip to an out-of-this-world car museum - but will Winston be able to hold it together when the team comes up against some of the world’s best gymnasts from the USA and France. Back in Birmingham, the display girls get to grips with a new routine in preparation for a performance in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games. Coach Lisa has given the girls a new challenge – not only do they have to perfect their routine, but they also have to choreograph part of it themselves.</desc>

Then, there’s a game based on sound and pitch, as Sam and Ayo play a tune using three hidden jars filled with different volumes of water. The teams must then figure out which order the jars go in to make the tune. Finally, a player from each team must memorise a pattern of animals on the Memory Path, before guiding their partner across it. In the lab, Sam and Ayo look at stopwatches and egg timers.

She chooses the cardboard tube and remembers the day she got it… Moira has allowed Suki to keep her pet mouse, Otto, in her office before his vet appointment - under strict instructions that his cage door stays closed. However, Moira can’t resist getting Otto out of his cage because he reminds her so much of the pet mouse she had when she was a child. When Moira breaks her own rule, Otto escapes. It’s a disaster! With Otto on the loose, it’s up to Daisy, Suki and Magnus to think of a clever and safe way to catch him.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ghislaine Maxwell: The Making of a Monster</title>
      <desc lang="en">This instalment of the documentary charts events in the steady demise of Ghislaine Maxwell. The socialite narrowly escaped an initial police investigation into the sexual abuse of dozens of underage girls in Epstein's Florida mansion. However, her subsequent rehabilitation as an environmentalist was scuppered when she went on the offensive against an accuser. Lawyers of survivors explain their innovative strategy that forced Ghislaine into a corner. It initiated a domino effect that eventually led to an ultimate reckoning - at the criminal trial that found her guilty in December 2021</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Sandi is joined by comedian and author Rosie Jones for a journey round the Midlands exploring the best staycation retreats they have to offer. The pair begin in Rutland where they stay at the Rocket Lodge, an eco-build made of upcycled grain silos that boasts a wood-fired hot-tub, a circular kitchen and a disco bathroom. In the sand dunes on a strip of the Lincolnshire coastline, the duo stay in a rebooted 70s beach house called Sandy Feet where Sandi learns that 'Netflix and chill' doesn't mean what she thinks it does. They end their trip close to the Welsh border on the Walcot Estate in a 200-year-old hideaway known as the Wheelwright's shop that once lived 20 miles away but was dismantled and transported piece by piece before being rebuilt to look exactly the same</desc>

      <desc lang="en">John Hurt reprises his role as Quentin Crisp in this sequel to The Naked Civil Servant, picking up his story where the 1975 drama about the eccentric Englishman left off. Crisp sets off on the journey of a lifetime to the Big Apple, where the Americans immediately embrace the openly gay writer and his waspish ways, and before long he is being wined and dined by celebrities in every corner of Manhattan. But, as is so often the case with Quentin, he cannot resist making outrageous comments, and an ill-considered quip about the growing Aids crisis sees him suddenly dropped from high society. Sex and the City's Cynthia Nixon co-stars as performance artist Penny Arcade, with Jonathan Tucker, Denis O'Hare and Swoosie Kurtz</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Paul Murton visits Gigha and Jura, two islands of the Inner Hebrides that are only a few miles apart but could not be more different. He begins at the Achamore Gardens on Gigha, which were created in the 1930s by the malted-drink millionaire James Horlick. He loved Gigha's mild climate so much that he bought the island and made it his home. Today Gigha is owned by the community, and many of its residents are incomers attracted by the opportunity to begin a new island life on this small and fertile place. Where Gigha is small, lush and verdant, Jura is rugged and awe-inspiring. Despite being one of Scotland's largest islands, just 200 people live there - alongside more than 5,000 deer</desc>
