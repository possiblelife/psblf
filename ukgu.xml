Millions of children have been forced to leave their homes to escape the fighting, but many either others couldn’t or didn’t. Hearing from just some of those who are living through war, this film lets the children caught in the conflict tell their stories in their own words. Covering fear, loss, strength and hope, they detail the life-changing events of the war and the impact it is having on their day-to-day life. They share their experiences of surviving attacks from the air, being forced to live for weeks at a time in bomb shelters, and their towns and villages becoming occupied by Russian soldiers. Ricky Boleto finds out how the children are coping with living in a country at war.</desc>

She then cycles off before telling him what a sipping host does. Love Monster goes to Elder Panda to ask his advice, and he tells him there are many ways to serve hot chocolate - each person needs to find their own unique way. Elder Panda adds honey and banana from his garden to his. Love Monster starts the ceremony by adding his signature marshmallows, but then Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny announces she puts marshmallows in hers too. Love Monster thinks he needs to use something more unusual, so he adds pickles, but this doesn't go down well - in fact, it tastes horrible! It turns out the reason why he was chosen was so that he could make hot chocolate the way he always makes it. He does, and everyone loves it.</desc>

This subject is explored through play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate birthday party toy or object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler! Storytime is all about fun and playful discovery, as the Toddler Twins’ friend Koala throws a surprise birthday party for Panda! Viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring the birthday party theme too. And, The Big Band Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with stretching and the Goodbye song.</desc>

This theme is explored through play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate superheroes toy or object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler! Storytime is all about joining in with physical actions, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear visit the park to practice their superhero skills!

Love Monster looks at all the other kites and sees the dragon kite, which is the largest kite of them all. Love Monster’s small kite doesn’t seem that exciting any more. He decides to try the dragon kite for just a minute. At first it seems easy, but then a wind gets it tangled in a tree. The rope breaks, and the kite flies off, causing mayhem in Fluffytown with everyone thinking it is a real dragon invasion. Finally, Elder Panda arrives and manages to bring it down to the ground using an umbrella, and Love Monster comes clean, saying how sorry he is. Elder Panda is disappointed but he does understand, as he too wanted to fly before he could run, but sometimes you have to start small before going big.</desc>
