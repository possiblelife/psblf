Find out as comedian and former psychiatric nurse Jo Brand joins Rattus to host a special episode in honour of the NHS’s 75th birthday. They discover how the NHS came to be, some of its weirder moments, and what life was like before we had the NHS to look after us. Did you know that before the NHS, getting medical help could be both difficult and expensive? We take a look at the role of the almoner, who decided who would have to pay for their treatment, and how much, before Nye Bevan comes along with his notion of free health care for all. We learn the story of the first NHS baby (and how she was encouraged to wait a few minutes before actually coming into the world), of how nurses were recruited in large numbers and how, with ventures such as the Common Cold Unit, the NHS tried to learn about how our health could be improved using some weird and wonderful methods.

      <desc lang="en">Plastic is one of the greatest inventions in human history. It makes so much of our lives possible, but how we dispose of it is now a massive problem. By the year 2050 it's thought that there will be more plastic than fish in our seas. So what can we do about it? First, ditch the disposable plastic water bottle and go for tap water in a reusable bottle. Better for the environment and cheaper too! Next, join a beach clean. It may seem like this problem is too big for us to handle but many hands make light work. Reduce, reuse and, importantly, recycle. And even more importantly than that, don't drop litter. A bag that is thrown on the streets of London could end up on the coast of Africa or in the belly of a whale or a turtle. Lastly and most importantly, know that every single person can make a difference. One single plastic bag could choke a turtle or sunfish. One plastic straw could be the end of a gorgeous, iconic animal, so know you have power and use it.</desc>

At the base of the mountain, Love Monster hands out equipment to Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny, Bad Idea Puppy and Book Cub. But when he tries to talk through his plan and warm-up, his friends play with their equipment and have fun doing their own exercises. A little frustrated, Love Monster blows his whistle to get their attention and says it’s time to start climbing.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">This instalment of the documentary charts events in the steady demise of Ghislaine Maxwell. The socialite narrowly escaped an initial police investigation into the sexual abuse of dozens of underage girls in Epstein's Florida mansion. However, her subsequent rehabilitation as an environmentalist was scuppered when she went on the offensive against an accuser. Lawyers of survivors explain their innovative strategy that forced Ghislaine into a corner. It initiated a domino effect that eventually led to an ultimate reckoning - at the criminal trial that found her guilty in December 2021</desc>

The likes of Oliver Twist's Fagin and the Artful Dodger live alongside and interact with the wealthy Barbarys of Bleak House, and the homely Cratchitts of A Christmas Carol, in events that eventually set up the stories featured in their respective novels. The saga begins on Christmas Eve, as Amelia and Arthur Havisham gather to hear the reading of their father's will, and the ruthless nature of debt collector Jacob Marley appears to give someone a motive for murder. Starring Stephen Rea, Pauline Collins, Caroline Quentin, Tom Weston-Jones, Tuppence Middleton, Anton Lesser and Omid Djalili</desc>

The story inspired the 1949 movie Whisky Galore!

He begins at the Achamore Gardens on Gigha, which were created in the 1930s by the malted-drink millionaire James Horlick. He loved Gigha's mild climate so much that he bought the island and made it his home. Today Gigha is owned by the community, and many of its residents are incomers attracted by the opportunity to begin a new island life on this small and fertile place. Where Gigha is small, lush and verdant, Jura is rugged and awe-inspiring. Despite being one of Scotland's largest islands, just 200 people live there - alongside more than 5,000 deer</desc>
