However, at a recent competition, Zion had an awkward landing and has started feeling pain in his lower back. His physio has suggested he has an MRI scan to work out the cause of the pain and see what can be done to fix it. Club-mate Winston has been asked to represent his club in the British Club Championships, where the best of the gym clubs battle it out to find out which is the best club in the country. Not only does he have the pressure of representing his club, but he will be teammates with gymnastic superstars that include two of his heroes: Olympian and World champion Joe Fraser and Commonwealth Gold winner Dom Cunningham. Back in the gym, Alice is working with some of the younger gymnasts, demonstrating how to do the perfect teddy bear roll.</desc>
