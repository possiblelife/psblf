In this documentary, she shows us how she does her hair at home, doing her own hair, her mum's hair, her sister's hair, her friend's hair and even her dad's beard. Shemhas been doing lots of different hairstyles for everyone, inlcuding twists, braids (thick and small), plaits, tops buns, and also leaving it out as an afro, which is really good for the hair and scalp. Chelcea is an expert on the science of hair and how to look after it, and is particularity interested in natural hair remedies. Chelcea's parents encourage their daughter's passion and, through beautiful animation, we learn about her mum's childhood in the Democratic Republic of Congo. By taking us on her own hair journey, Chelcea's determination to inspire others to celebrate their amazing hair shines through!</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Arthur Sleep is joined by team captains Gail Force and Keith Fitt in this slapstick quiz show featuring guests and clips from Gigglebiz. Joining Gail and Keith for today’s GiggleQuiz are Wizard Tripwick and Captain Adorable. Round 1 features clips starring Professor Muddles showing off his recycling machine, and Dina Lady delivering one of her delicious cakes. Wizard Tripwick tries to guess the answer by using his wand. It all goes wrong in a very messy way, and a large cake ends up all over Gail. Wizard Tripwick receives a package from a magical pigeon, unwrapping it to reveal a brand new wand. Keen to test it out, he conjures Gail a cup of tea. Unfortunately, this new wand is more powerful than he thought! Round 2 is Nana’s Panto Showdown, and this time it features Nana’s frogs hopping into the pond to look for her socks. Round 3 features a clip starring DIY Dan making a garden for his gnomes. Wizard Tripwick is confident he’s got the hang of this new wand and offers help to everyone</desc>

The story inspired the 1949 movie Whisky Galore! Moving on to Barra, Paul goes foraging for cockles and visits the only airport in the world where scheduled flights land on the beach, then heads across to Vatersay, where he joins local fishermen trawling for lobsters</desc>
