First, they must decide whether objects will float or sink in a water tank. Then, in a game based on light and shadows, the young scientists have to figure out what their team captains are holding by observing their shadows behind a huge screen. Finally, the teams learn about structures by building arched bridges they can step across to reach an island. Meanwhile, Sam and Ayo are competing to see who can make the best model rocket. The scientist who loses must clean the other’s dirty lab beakers for a week! Who will triumph?</desc>

At the Museum of Cornish Treasures, Archie tells them that their treasure grew up in Cornwall under a big dome, and Suzy sends them to the Eden Project to find out more. Here, they meet Catherine who says their treasure is a type of fruit from a place far away. But how did the fruit get to Cornwall? Suzy buzzes on the Treasure Comm and suggests Fred and Pete take a trip on a zip wire and explore the tropical dome. They meet Catherine again who reveals their treasure is a screw pine fruit. This fruit is usually found in hot countries in Asia and Africa but is able to grow in Eden’s dome because it's so warm inside. Catherine takes Fred and Pete on a plant hunt around the tropical dome. Catherine explains how fruits produce seeds which then grow into new trees that produce fruits themselves</desc>

    <title lang="en">Maddie, the Plants and You</title>
      <desc lang="en">Join Maddie on a journey of discovery to find out about plants around the world. Find out how we can help to look after them and our planet, and why and how they grow and survive in different climates. Maddie explores plants in the rainforest, big and small, and sees how the clever drip-tip leaves work watering the plants beneath them. We’ll see how plants in hot, dry parts of world like the desert thrive in their own special ways, like the cactus plant that stores litres of water in its waxy leaves. And we’ll learn how plants that grow close to home in the UK, can grow in a colder and wetter climate.</desc>
