      <desc lang="en">Wales v England (Kick-off 4.45pm). All the action from both teams' third match of the Championship, held at Principality Stadium.

Steve Borthwick's men also lost to the Scots, but they did bounce back with a victory at home to Italy and will now be looking to build momentum with back-to-back wins</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Jessie Cave, Sadie Clayton and Ricky Martin search for Britain’s Best Young Artist. It’s the botanical round, and the three artists have to create a piece of art that perfectly captures the beauty of nature. To help them do so, Ricky takes them beekeeping and shows them some wet-and-dry watercolour techniques they can use to add detail to their work. They then return to the art studio to create their artworks in the given time. But who will Ricky and Sadie pick to go through to the next semi-final?</desc>

Roy can't believe it ­ he loves all of his toys and doesn't want to give any to Mrs Barker's Charity Shop, The Old Bag. Roy isn't the only family member having trouble parting with their old, unused items. Bill becomes incredibly attached to some old tight fitting clothes, and there's a scarf Maura has her eye on too. Mr Barker is just as reluctant as Roy, and when Mrs Barker is about to catch them both hiding out in Reg's shed, Roy wonders what Wonder Roy would do? Wonder Roy loses his brand new cape in a villainous encounter with The Messer and Glitterella. He had given Finn his old cape ­ much to Finn's delight, and is reluctant to take it back, but Finn reassures him that who we are is much more important than the things we own. Back in reality, Roy remembers this, and teaches Mr Barker how good it feels to pass things on!</desc>

Joan does the honours, but every time she changes Roy's hairstyle, it plops back to its original appearance. Roy is crestfallen to realise he cannot change the way he looks. What would Wonder Roy do? In Toonville, Wonder Roy combats Gliterella with his new creation - a soapy water pistol. But, being Wonder Roy, he allows her the creative freedom to add a bit of sparkle to the dreary local library. Back in reality, Roy uses his creativity to fashion a wig for himself, but sadly accepts he is wasting his time. Bill points Roy's cartoon uniqueness and creative flair is something to be proud of.

Parents, carers and their little ones at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! The What's in the Box? game reveals a plastic knife, fork and spoon, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are all inspired by the phrase 'let's eat'. This theme is explored through exploration, play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate 'let's eat' object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about joining in with physical actions, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear help Big Bear to make a tasty apple pie! Viewers at home show how they've been exploring the 'let's eat' theme too. Plus, the Big Band Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with stretching and the Goodbye song</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Wales v England (Kick-off 4.45pm). All the action from both teams' third match of the Championship, held at Principality Stadium. England recorded a narrow 23-19 victory when the sides met at Twickenham last year, and Warren Gatland's return as head coach has so far failed to revive Welsh fortunes, with his team suffering defeats at the hands of Ireland and Scotland in their opening two matches. Steve Borthwick's men also lost to the Scots, but they did bounce back with a victory at home to Italy and will now be looking to build momentum with back-to-back wins</desc>
