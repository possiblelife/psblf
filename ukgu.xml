Elder Kitten is a little lost for words and, not wanting to hurt their feelings, he simply agrees with them that it's bright and very different. Love Monster can tell that Elder Kitten doesn't like it, and eventually Elder Kitten gently admits that it's not really his style</desc>

Together, they make the best team! Kika needs to help Dr Amit catch a train to the city. First, they must walk to the station. Kika knows the way like the back of her paw, but there are some important things they must do along the way. Kika has to help Dr Amit navigate a pelican crossing, using a top secret cone to cross the road safely. Then she must guide him through the station and up the escalator to the platform. There are some hazards to avoid, including a tumbling box full of Kika’s favourite snacks - carrots! Then, at the station, their mission is almost derailed by a last-minute platform change. Can Kika’s supersight save the day?</desc>

Italy have been competitive in all their matches so far, but are still without a win.

In contrast, England have endured a disappointing campaign, defeating Italy and Wales, but suffering home defeats at the hands of Scotland and France, the latter which was a 53-10 thrashing last time out. With analysis from Jonny Wilkinson, Brian O'Driscoll, Rory Best and Clive Woodward, commentary by Nick Mullins, Gordon D'Arcy and Lawrence Dallaglio, and reports from Martin Bayfield</desc>

Received wisdom has long suggested the culprit was bubonic plague, spread by the fleas of infected rats, and an unexpected discovery made by Crossrail engineers working on a shaft on the edge of London's Charterhouse Square in 2013 provides a new insight into how the disease passed from host to host. This documentary follows experts from a range of disciplines as they pick through the evidence, reveal why the disease killed on such a large scale, and discuss how it still poses a threat today</desc>
