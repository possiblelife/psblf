      <desc lang="en">Plastic is one of the greatest inventions in human history. It makes so much of our lives possible, but how we dispose of it is now a massive problem. By the year 2050 it's thought that there will be more plastic than fish in our seas. So what can we do about it? First, ditch the disposable plastic water bottle and go for tap water in a reusable bottle. Better for the environment and cheaper too! Next, join a beach clean. It may seem like this problem is too big for us to handle but many hands make light work. Reduce, reuse and, importantly, recycle. And even more importantly than that, don't drop litter. A bag that is thrown on the streets of London could end up on the coast of Africa or in the belly of a whale or a turtle. Lastly and most importantly, know that every single person can make a difference. One single plastic bag could choke a turtle or sunfish. One plastic straw could be the end of a gorgeous, iconic animal, so know you have power and use it.</desc>

Even though his team are there to support him, he has to face his fear and take on the pommel, the apparatus that has caused him more than his fair share of problems during the last season. The boys also face the distraction of a trip to an out-of-this-world car museum - but will Winston be able to hold it together when the team comes up against some of the world’s best gymnasts from the USA and France. Back in Birmingham, the display girls get to grips with a new routine in preparation for a performance in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games. Coach Lisa has given the girls a new challenge – not only do they have to perfect their routine, but they also have to choreograph part of it themselves.</desc>

Love Monster goes to Elder Panda to ask his advice, and he tells him there are many ways to serve hot chocolate - each person needs to find their own unique way. Elder Panda adds honey and banana from his garden to his. Love Monster starts the ceremony by adding his signature marshmallows, but then Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny announces she puts marshmallows in hers too. Love Monster thinks he needs to use something more unusual, so he adds pickles, but this doesn't go down well - in fact, it tastes horrible! It turns out the reason why he was chosen was so that he could make hot chocolate the way he always makes it. He does, and everyone loves it.</desc>

Round one is fancy fashion foodies, and everyone loves Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny, so Love Monster thinks he can just pick her. Then it is round two - the veggie variety show. Everyone loves the In-Chicks, so Love Monster now has to choose between them and Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny. Then it is the final round, which is the tantalizing taste test of home grown goodies, and this time everyone loves Bad Idea Puppy. Love Monster has no idea how he can pick a winner and runs off and hides, but then he realises Bad Idea Puppy always makes him laugh, so he declares him the winner.</desc>

He then adds garlic puree, ginger puree, chutney and chopped tomatoes to cooked beef mince. Sebastiaan then carefully makes powder out of his special ingredient, cumin seeds, and adds the powder to the beef mixture. Sebastiaan mixes both the vegetables and the beef in an oven dish and flattens them before adding two bay leaves. He adds a topping of milk and egg and then places it in the oven. Sebastiaan has a wonderfully decorated table, and he has another traditional treat to go with his bobotie. Will his friends figure out what his special ingredient is?</desc>

Before he goes, he tells Love Monster that soon it will be time for him to go on to his next kiting challenge. Love Monster looks at all the other kites and sees the dragon kite, which is the largest kite of them all. Love Monster’s small kite doesn’t seem that exciting any more. He decides to try the dragon kite for just a minute. At first it seems easy, but then a wind gets it tangled in a tree. The rope breaks, and the kite flies off, causing mayhem in Fluffytown with everyone thinking it is a real dragon invasion. Finally, Elder Panda arrives and manages to bring it down to the ground using an umbrella, and Love Monster comes clean, saying how sorry he is. Elder Panda is disappointed but he does understand, as he too wanted to fly before he could run, but sometimes you have to start small before going big.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Love Monster has been chosen as the prize-picker at the Harvest Day contest, but when he gets there it turns out there is only one prize and three teams. This means he has to choose a winner between his friends - Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny, Bad Idea Puppy and the In-Chicks. Round one is fancy fashion foodies, and everyone loves Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny, so Love Monster thinks he can just pick her. Then it is round two - the veggie variety show. Everyone loves the In-Chicks, so Love Monster now has to choose between them and Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny. Then it is the final round, which is the tantalizing taste test of home grown goodies, and this time everyone loves Bad Idea Puppy. Love Monster has no idea how he can pick a winner and runs off and hides, but then he realises Bad Idea Puppy always makes him laugh, so he declares him the winner.</desc>

Before he goes, he tells Love Monster that soon it will be time for him to go on to his next kiting challenge. Love Monster looks at all the other kites and sees the dragon kite, which is the largest kite of them all. Love Monster’s small kite doesn’t seem that exciting any more. He decides to try the dragon kite for just a minute. At first it seems easy, but then a wind gets it tangled in a tree. The rope breaks, and the kite flies off, causing mayhem in Fluffytown with everyone thinking it is a real dragon invasion. Finally, Elder Panda arrives and manages to bring it down to the ground using an umbrella, and Love Monster comes clean, saying how sorry he is. Elder Panda is disappointed but he does understand, as he too wanted to fly before he could run, but sometimes you have to start small before going big.</desc>

People starving to death, years of hard labour for those found watching foreign films and TV programmes, and execution for the ones who try to escape. Jean Mackenzie the BBC's correspondent in South Korea asks: is this a new dark age for North Korea? Part of the award winning Our World strand</desc>

As many women grapple with the stigma of addiction, the BBC has been given exclusive access to the first women's residential treatment centre for gambling, based in central England.
