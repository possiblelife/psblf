      <desc lang="en">The two finalists go head to head, each taking on the redesign of a trendy bar in London's vibrant Soho district. They have three days to make over the ground-floor bar and an intimate basement cocktail lounge - and to help, both contestants have a fellow team-mate, plus a team of trades. One designer goes all-out, relocating the bar to the other side of the room - but the more they rip out, the more it becomes a demolition zone. Down the road, there is indecision and angst as the other finalist realises just how much is at stake. Who will win the career-defining contract to design an upmarket apartment on the Cornish coast?</desc>

Grown-ups at home are encouraged to take part by hiding a safe, baby appropriate red toy or object inside a fabric bag or pillowcase for them to reveal and explore with their baby! The popular baby song Little Robin Redbreast features, as does a story involving Baby Bear and Baby Tiger, and viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring red things too.

Inside Nigel’s bag are a toy pig, a toy sheep and a toy chicken, and all the parents and babies have different objects and toys that are themed around things you might find at a farm. These are explored through discovery, play, song and story. Grown-ups at home are encouraged to take part by hiding safe, baby-appropriate farm objects and toys inside a fabric bag or pillowcase for them to reveal and explore with their baby! The fun song Old MacDonald Had A Farm features, as does a story involving Baby Bear, and viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring farm things too. The Together Song gets everyone moving about before some calm time with sensory scarves and the Goodbye Song.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Until it closed in 1966 the Deeside Railway followed the River Dee upstream from Aberdeen into what is now the Cairngorms National Park. As luck would have it, Queen Victoria purchased Balmoral just as the line was set to open, giving the route prestige. Rob Bell retraces the route, visiting a shooting estate, tossing a caber and finding an unmistakable Highland 'brand' that all owe their existence to this royal railway age. He also explores a quiet valley of cattle farming and timber sawmills, and, in truth, a simple railway that struggled for decades to justify its own existence, despite its royal veneer</desc>

After that, he and the team come up with a bespoke lighting system for the evenings, acoustic fencing to cut down the noise from a nearby railway line, and an area for the parents</desc>
