      <desc lang="en">Running a marathon is hard. At least it is for a human. But what if we could swap our legs with an animal – would that make it any easier?First, we try on a pair of kangaroo legs. Rather than jump from one leg to the other, kangaroos keep their legs together and store the energy from each bounce in special ligaments that act like springs. They recycle the energy so that the kangaroo can travel long distances with very little effort. This efficient style of locomotion helps them get around the Australian bush, where it can be a long way between places with food and water. However, they get tired after around 30km and so a 42km marathon would be too much for them.So what about the longer legs of a T. rex? They have a stride length of around 4 metres compared to 1 metre for a human. And they can travel up to 50km. However, scientists believe that T. rex was too heavy to be able to run – if they tried they’d probably break their legs. So maybe we’re stuck with our human legs. But don’t</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hey You What If?</title>
      <desc lang="en">On the face of it, humans are a bit breakable. We have these hard skeletons that can crack if you have a tumble. But if we were indestructible, like a superhero, then we’d never have to worry about ending up in plaster! So what’s the best way? First we try removing the problem – it’s our bones that break, so let’s get rid of them altogether. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work very well. Without our bones we’d basically be blobs and unable to move anywhere. Okay, metal is tough right? How about taking inspiration from knights in armour, and making our skin solid metal? The problem with metal is that if you hit it hard enough it will actually bend. So, your metal skin would soon be covered with dents and you’d end up completely bent out of shape. What we need is something that can take the knocks without changing shape permanently. What we need is something like rubber, something ‘elastic.’ Elastic materials deform when you hit or stretch them but then they spring back to their original sh</desc>

      <desc lang="en">It’s literally a packed show as the OZT HQ is crammed full of some of the fastest-swimming marine life and deepest divers surrounding Britain’s shores. Tyler takes the plunge in Plymouth to reveal how a special marine plant is being brought back from the edge of extinction to help fight climate change. Plucking up courage, he then dives deep to swim with sharks and is amazed by what he discovers about this incredible but sometimes misunderstood species. Just off Britain’s north east coast, Cam also slips into his wetsuit to go snorkelling with seal whisperer Ben. Getting up close with some inquisitive seals, he learns of the threats they face from plastic pollution. It’s all eyes on the Scottish skies as the OZT brothers go on a mission to the Isle of Mull to look for the ultimate soaring sea bird, the white-tailed eagle - but who will spot one first, and can Cam get the perfect picture? Back at OZT HQ, Aaron’s animal knowledge gets put to the test with some quickfire questions from th</desc>

Charli has been invited to a party but is feeling a bit nervous about going. Tinks loves helping Charli feel confident. She wants to help Charli feel good about herself so she can go and have fun at the party. Tinks fetches Charli’s hair brush so Charli can brush her newly-dyed pink hair, and then helps Charli choose a party outfit. And, when Charli can’t find her keys, Tinks dives into a mountain of clothes on the bed to search for them. Now they’re party ready, but it's raining! Tinks is determined to help Charli get to the party, even in the rain. But how? She summons all her big dog energy and sets off in search of a plan. Just wait until Dog Squad hear about this!</desc>
