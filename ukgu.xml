Inside Giovanna’s bag are colourful sheets of sandpaper, and all the parents and little ones have different objects and toys that feel rough. These are explored through discovery, play, song and story. Grown-ups at home are encouraged to take part by hiding a safe, baby-appropriate rough object or toy inside a fabric bag or pillowcase for them to reveal and explore with their baby! The nursery rhyme Michael Finnegan features, as does a story involving Baby Bear and Baby Tiger, and viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring rough things too. The Baby Bear Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with sensory lights and the Goodbye Song.</desc>

Now they are no longer a threat, the team follows the ants into their tree. Ubercorn and Glitch tuck into their picnic, but an ant steals the cherry from Glitch’s cake and takes it inside the tree. Unable fit inside, Glitch uses his size-ray to shrink himself and zooms after the ant. Inside the tree, the ants see Glitch as a threat and start to surround him.

Lars loves these tough little birds and explains how, although they spend most of their lives flying out to sea and fishing, they return to land each year to lay their eggs. When the baby birds, also called pufflings, eventually hatch, they fly out towards the ocean. But the light from nearby towns often confuses them about where to go, leading local children and adults to form 'puffin patrols' to rescue the pufflings. Lars is excited to help out but is upset when he discovers Glitch, also a fan of puffins, is already well-known on the islands for his skills as a puffin rescuer. Although Glitch offers him a place in his puffin patrol, Lars is determined to outdo Glitch with a patrol of his own - but when he recruits a clumsy Grimbot, things take a turn for the worse...</desc>

    <title lang="en">Our World</title>
      <desc lang="en">Once dubbed the 'murder capital' of the world, for nearly three decades, rival gangs ruled the streets of El Salvador through a regime of violence, extortion and fear. That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Once dubbed the 'murder capital' of the world, for nearly three decades, rival gangs ruled the streets of El Salvador through a regime of violence, extortion and fear. That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Witches: A Century of Murder</title>
      <desc lang="en">Suzannah Lipscomb's investigation into the notorious 17th-century witch trials concludes with a profile of Matthew Hopkins, the opportunistic puritan witch-hunter who transformed paranoia about Satanism into a lucrative business as he hanged hundreds of people for crimes they could not possibly have committed. Making use of contemporary reports, Suzannah paints a portrait of a man who believed he could cross any boundary and break any law to achieve his goals. Naming himself 'Witchfinder General', Hopkins toured the country charging fees for his services, but Suzannah's research reveals that ultimately, the public's distaste for witches was not as strong as its hatred of being conned by charlatans. Hopkins would eventually die of tuberculosis in relative obscurity, but his malign legacy lived on across the Atlantic, as witch-hunts began in Salem, Massachusetts</desc>
