However, at a recent competition, Zion had an awkward landing and has started feeling pain in his lower back. His physio has suggested he has an MRI scan to work out the cause of the pain and see what can be done to fix it. Club-mate Winston has been asked to represent his club in the British Club Championships, where the best of the gym clubs battle it out to find out which is the best club in the country. Not only does he have the pressure of representing his club, but he will be teammates with gymnastic superstars that include two of his heroes: Olympian and World champion Joe Fraser and Commonwealth Gold winner Dom Cunningham. Back in the gym, Alice is working with some of the younger gymnasts, demonstrating how to do the perfect teddy bear roll.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Nigel and Baby Bear welcome little ones Minnie, Luna, Oliver, River, Theo and their grown-ups to The Baby Club. Parents, carers and their babies at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! Inside Nigel’s bag are a toy pig, a toy sheep and a toy chicken, and all the parents and babies have different objects and toys that are themed around things you might find at a farm. These are explored through discovery, play, song and story. Grown-ups at home are encouraged to take part by hiding safe, baby-appropriate farm objects and toys inside a fabric bag or pillowcase for them to reveal and explore with their baby! The fun song Old MacDonald Had A Farm features, as does a story involving Baby Bear, and viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring farm things too. The Together Song gets everyone moving about before some calm time with sensory scarves and the Goodbye Song.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Hugh Dennis heads a team excavating back gardens around Britain. Joined by archaeological scientist and lecturer at Newcastle University Dr Chloe Duckworth, field archaeologist Natasha Bilson, and author and archaeologist John Henry Phillips, he reveals a new chapter of Roman history in Cornwall, at a recently discovered Roman fort near Calstock. Little was previously known about the Romans in this part of England, but the indications from the team's excavation are that the Romans were not in the south west solely for a military campaign. Hugh also visits the reconstructed Lunt Roman Fort in Coventry</desc>
