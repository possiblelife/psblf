We discover how thrust and rocket fuel work, when a rocket engine blasts off from the launch pad and into space, and learn about the different parts of the rocket and what they are for. Next, we find out about the special computers on-board that guide astronauts through space, and Maddie rides a very fast rollercoaster to show us how G-force works when a rocket launches. Finally, we find out how a rocket lands safely to bring the astronauts back to Earth.</desc>

At the Museum of Cornish Treasures, Archie tells them that their treasure grew up in Cornwall under a big dome, and Suzy sends them to the Eden Project to find out more. Here, they meet Catherine who says their treasure is a type of fruit from a place far away. But how did the fruit get to Cornwall? Suzy buzzes on the Treasure Comm and suggests Fred and Pete take a trip on a zip wire and explore the tropical dome. They meet Catherine again who reveals their treasure is a screw pine fruit. This fruit is usually found in hot countries in Asia and Africa but is able to grow in Eden’s dome because it's so warm inside. Catherine takes Fred and Pete on a plant hunt around the tropical dome. Catherine explains how fruits produce seeds which then grow into new trees that produce fruits themselves</desc>

Mack is convinced Dad won’t forget and recruits Caitlin to help him find out if any special plans are afoot. James’s surprise for Mack is a little delayed, but Caitlin overhears him on the phone talking about a special delivery. She rushes to tell Mack; it must be for him. Later, in the cafe, the special delivery arrives and Mack thinks it’s for him. When James steps forward and says the package is for the baby, Mack walks away upset; it seems Dad has forgotten his birthday after all. At the Kids Club, Caitlin tells James that Mack is upset.

      <desc lang="en">Following three shark attacks in two years just metres from a beach in the Red Sea vacation resort of Hurghada, Egypt, this documentary investigates the recent shift in shark behaviour and whether human activity and climate change could be the causes. Professor Gavin Naylor of the University of Florida looks back to the evolution of sharks for answers while Dr Dean Grubbs of Florida State University gets hands on, catching sharks to study and better understand their movements. Dr Laura Ryan, of Macquarie University, explains her research into a possible case of mistaken identity in which the sharks are mistaking humans for their preferred prey of seals.</desc>

This programme explores the issue of expectant mothers who find themselves with no place to call home, and conducts a survey of midwives in collaboration with the Royal College of Midwives to try to get a sense of the scale of the problem. Ninety-five per cent of the midwives asked strongly felt that homelessness puts the health of the women and their unborn babies at risk. The report follows three women - two of whom are heavily pregnant - experiencing evictions, overcrowding and the reality of living in temporary accommodation for years on end</desc>
