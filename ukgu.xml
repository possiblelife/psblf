It’s time to head back to the museum to see what Suzy and Archie make of it. Archie reveals that this object will ‘keep you safe and sound’, while Suzy finds a photo of a friend of hers with a big metal object just like the one Fred and Pete found. She sends them back to the beach to meet him. Fred and Pete arrive on the beach and are startled to see what looks like an alien with a metal object just like theirs, walking up to them. The ‘alien’ is actually Suzy's friend Iain, and he explains that the metal object on his head is a helmet for a very old-fashioned deep sea diving suit. Fred and Pete then wonder what divers do when they’re underwater. Suzy sends them to the other end of the beach to meet Hannah from the Cornish Diving Centre, who tells them about modern diving equipment and how they use it. Hannah invites Fred</desc>

One by one, the porter takes each suitcase away, and the Twirlywoos move down the line, hiding behind different cases. When there is only one suitcase left, the Twirlywoos have nowhere else to hide. Instead of coming out from their hiding place, they take their hiding place with them - much to the porter's confusion. Back on The Big Red Boat, a mischievous mouse entertains on the Twirlywoo Screen. Where is he hiding?</desc>

Suzy sends the boys off to a fishmonger, where Kay points out that the horn is a huer’s horn used to helped fishermen find fish. But how could blowing a horn help anyone find fish? Suzy rings on the Treasure Comm and directs Fred and Pete to visit a huer’s hut on the cliffs above Newquay. There, they meet Karl, who explains that the horn was blown to indicate that the huer had seen some fish. Karl then shows Fred and Pete how the huer would use signals to get the fishing fleet into position. Fred and Pete decide to put this to the test. Unfortunately, the wind and a swarm of bees play havoc with Pete’s directions, but Fred somehow ends up back in the fishmonger, where he buys some Cornish sardines. Suzy ring</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gino's Italian Escape</title>
      <desc lang="en">Gino D'Acampo journeys across Italy's two biggest islands, Sardinia and Sicily, revealing how for many Italians the most important thing in life is food. Having made Sardinia his home from home for the past three years, the chef is keen to explore the island, through its food, people and landscape. He learns about the prized dish of roasted suckling pig - and hosts a traditional Festa for his friends. Then he heads to the north of the island, visiting Alghero, a medieval walled town. Influenced by the Spanish, he experiences its architecture and its food</desc>
