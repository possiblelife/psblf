Justin decides that instead of taking any clothes, he’s going to fill his suitcase with his favourite comic books instead. He doesn’t know where they’re going, but as long as there’s a pool to sit by whilst he reads his comics, he’ll be happy. Robert leads them all off on their surprise holiday, only to arrive back seconds later. The surprise is that they’re visiting the ‘Justin’s House Holiday Park’ based right here in Justin’s House.</desc>
