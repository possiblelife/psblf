She starts by adding garlic puree, Korean chilli paste, soy sauce, honey, toasted sesame oil and her special ingredient, sesame seeds, into a jug and mixing them all up. Next, Hannah puts pieces of her salmon onto individual baking sheets and spoons the marinade on. She garnishes them with freshly chopped spring onions, and then her salmon is ready to be cooked in the oven. Hannah wears a colourful Korean outfit and treats her friends to some local Korean kimchi, but will her pals be able to guess her special ingredient?</desc>

For the pumpkin filling: he pours melted butter and buttermilk into a bowl of brown sugar, along with whisked egg, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice and cloves. Febo adds his special ingredient, pumpkin puree, and then mixes them all together. When it's mixed, he spoons it into the empty pastry case and puts it in the oven to cook. Febo's friends all help to decorate his American-themed table before they taste his pumpkin pie.</desc>

Diesel helps Rayane find the pet food aisle, where he chooses his pet food and a new toy, while being careful to choose one without a squeaker. Squeakers are for training time, not playtime. But then there’s an emergency at the cafe when the smoke alarm goes off, and the cafe has to be evacuated.
