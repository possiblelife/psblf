From there, they hit the white beaches of Porta Bianca before taking in some more history in Syracuse.

    <title lang="en">The Toddler Club</title>
      <desc lang="en">Nigel, Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear welcome toddlers Freddie, Dylan, William and Afal, and their grown-ups to the Toddler Club. Parents, carers and their little ones at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! The What's in the Box? game reveals a wooden toy aeroplane, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are all inspired by an 'in the air' theme. This subject is explored through exploration, play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate 'in the air' object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler. Storytime is all about joining in with physical actions, as Benjee Bear and Bailee Bear are given a kite as a present. The twins go outside to fly it, but things don't quite go to plan when the kite gets stuck in a tree! Viewers at home show how they've been exploring the 'in the air' theme too. Plus, the Big Band Song </desc>

Charli has been invited to a party but is feeling a bit nervous about going. Tinks loves helping Charli feel confident. She wants to help Charli feel good about herself so she can go and have fun at the party. Tinks fetches Charli’s hair brush so Charli can brush her newly-dyed pink hair, and then helps Charli choose a party outfit. And, when Charli can’t find her keys, Tinks dives into a mountain of clothes on the bed to search for them. Now they’re party ready, but it's raining! Tinks is determined to help Charli get to the party, even in the rain. But how? She summons all her big dog energy and sets off in search of a plan. Just wait until Dog Squad hear about this!</desc>

From there, they hit the white beaches of Porta Bianca before taking in some more history in Syracuse. Today, it is just a provincial city, but more than 2,700 years ago it was one of the largest colonies in the ancient Greek world, and some of the original buildings remain inside the city's Archaeological Park. Their final stop is the island's second city Catania, a place very significant to Giovanni as he moved there aged 14 to further his dance career</desc>

We also speak to one of the women fighting for the equal right to pray at the Western Wall in Jerusalem. We meet the forensic anthropologist in Argentina who founded a team dedicated to digging for evidence of crimes against humanity. In Canada, we speak to one of the Mohawk activists who spent months in a stand-off with the country's military over plans to develop a golf course on sacred burial ground. Plus, how an anti-war march turned into a peace camp that endured for nearly 20 years outside an American air base in rural England.</desc>
