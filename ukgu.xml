Aaron and Cam go off-road in a bumpy dash across the wilds of Exmoor to try and gather more than 100 semi-wild ponies off the moor for their annual health check. Cam meets 12-year-old wildlife hero and butterfly champion Rebecca to find out why she is so fascinated with butterflies. Meanwhile, Tyler heads to the Forest of Dean to team up with ‘the snake whisperer’, on a mission to track down an adder, one of our most secretive and threatened snakes. In the heart of mid Wales, Aaron meets a wildlife hero who has played a big part in the recent success story of the red kite, and he is blown away when hundreds of red kites fill the sky. Back at OZT HQ, Cam gets his hands on the latest wildlife filming kit to give us the low-down on how the incredible shots of high-jumping hares were filmed in Sir David Attenborough’s Wild Isles series.

Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny does better than he does, and Love Monster feels jealous of the attention that she gets. He becomes so frustrated that he kicks a beanbag and it hurtles towards the scoreboard, knocking all the points to the ground, ripping the bunting and giving Delivery Duckling, Elder Chick, Elder Panda and the In-Chicks a fright. The crowd is stunned into silence. Love Monster is horrified at what he has done and immediately says sorry. He explains that he wants everyone to cheer for him like they cheer for Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny. She admits it did feel good and tingly inside when everyone was cheering for her, but she says that everyone has something they are good at and Love Monster is the best beatboxer in Fluffytown. Love Monster realises that she is right and starts beatboxing. The Fluffytowners start having fun again and begin cheering for him.</desc>

Bob and Ted tell them how they used to pretend to be one another when they were boys. This gives Molly an idea! Bob and Ted could play the same trick again, on everyone in the Hub. Soon, Molly and Bob are up on the balcony watching Ted pretending to be Bob at his stall. At first, the plan goes well, but things soon start to go wrong. Ted gets everyone’s names mixed up and he doesn’t know his plums from his apricots. Finally, when Moira asks ‘Bob’ to fix her spinny chair, we discover that Ted is a bit useless at mending things, and the game is most definitely up!</desc>
