This means he has to choose a winner between his friends - Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny, Bad Idea Puppy and the In-Chicks. Round one is fancy fashion foodies, and everyone loves Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny, so Love Monster thinks he can just pick her. Then it is round two - the veggie variety show. Everyone loves the In-Chicks, so Love Monster now has to choose between them and Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny. Then it is the final round, which is the tantalizing taste test of home grown goodies, and this time everyone loves Bad Idea Puppy. Love Monster has no idea how he can pick a winner and runs off and hides, but then he realises Bad Idea Puppy always makes him laugh, so he declares him the winner.</desc>

Love Monster looks at all the other kites and sees the dragon kite, which is the largest kite of them all. Love Monster’s small kite doesn’t seem that exciting any more. He decides to try the dragon kite for just a minute. At first it seems easy, but then a wind gets it tangled in a tree. The rope breaks, and the kite flies off, causing mayhem in Fluffytown with everyone thinking it is a real dragon invasion. Finally, Elder Panda arrives and manages to bring it down to the ground using an umbrella, and Love Monster comes clean, saying how sorry he is. Elder Panda is disappointed but he does understand, as he too wanted to fly before he could run, but sometimes you have to start small before going big.</desc>
