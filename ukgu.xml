    <title lang="en">Hey You What If?</title>
      <desc lang="en">On the face of it, humans are a bit breakable. We have these hard skeletons that can crack if you have a tumble. But if we were indestructible, like a superhero, then we’d never have to worry about ending up in plaster! So what’s the best way? First we try removing the problem – it’s our bones that break, so let’s get rid of them altogether. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work very well. Without our bones we’d basically be blobs and unable to move anywhere. Okay, metal is tough right? How about taking inspiration from knights in armour, and making our skin solid metal? The problem with metal is that if you hit it hard enough it will actually bend. So, your metal skin would soon be covered with dents and you’d end up completely bent out of shape. What we need is something that can take the knocks without changing shape permanently. What we need is something like rubber, something ‘elastic.’ Elastic materials deform when you hit or stretch them but then they spring back to their original sh</desc>

Tyler takes the plunge in Plymouth to reveal how a special marine plant is being brought back from the edge of extinction to help fight climate change. Plucking up courage, he then dives deep to swim with sharks and is amazed by what he discovers about this incredible but sometimes misunderstood species. Just off Britain’s north east coast, Cam also slips into his wetsuit to go snorkelling with seal whisperer Ben. Getting up close with some inquisitive seals, he learns of the threats they face from plastic pollution. It’s all eyes on the Scottish skies as the OZT brothers go on a mission to the Isle of Mull to look for the ultimate soaring sea bird, the white-tailed eagle - but who will spot one first, and can Cam get the perfect picture?

    <title lang="en">Hey You What If?</title>
      <desc lang="en">If the beach is too far to go but you still want to spend some time surfing waves, then why not surf on land instead? Well, there are some very good reasons people don’t surf on land. To surf, you need waves which are steep enough that you can literally slide down them – that’s how surfing works. You slide down the face whilst the wave continuously picks you up so you can just keep sliding. Finding waves the right shape on land is quite a challenge. There are naturally occurring waves on land, but they are created as a result of dramatic seismic events like an earthquake or a volcanic eruption. And even if you were standing by a volcano when it went off, the waves it produces aren’t very steep and they’re not very tall. So you really couldn’t surf them. Which leaves you with two alternatives: A. Melt the ground so it becomes a liquid. But then the ground would be over 600 degrees centigrade and destroy your surf board. Or B. Fluidise the ground. Fluidising involves blowing air through </desc>

Aaron and Cam go off-road in a bumpy dash across the wilds of Exmoor to try and gather more than 100 semi-wild ponies off the moor for their annual health check. Cam meets 12-year-old wildlife hero and butterfly champion Rebecca to find out why she is so fascinated with butterflies. Meanwhile, Tyler heads to the Forest of Dean to team up with ‘the snake whisperer’, on a mission to track down an adder, one of our most secretive and threatened snakes. In the heart of mid Wales, Aaron meets a wildlife hero who has played a big part in the recent success story of the red kite, and he is blown away when hundreds of red kites fill the sky. Back at OZT HQ, Cam gets his hands on the latest wildlife filming kit to give us the low-down on how the incredible shots of high-jumping hares were filmed in Sir David Attenborough’s Wild Isles series. Aaron is put to the test with some quickfire </desc>

And Chantelle joins Aneeshwar, who is a keen bird watcher - together they try to spot a puffling, a baby puffin, in the cliffs. Chantelle and Rory’s fact files help answer all of Emily’s questions. With the help of the special poem, we discover that like lots of other teeny tiny creatures, puffins are superheroes, helping our planet in their own special way.

We also speak to one of the women fighting for the equal right to pray at the Western Wall in Jerusalem. We meet the forensic anthropologist in Argentina who founded a team dedicated to digging for evidence of crimes against humanity. In Canada, we speak to one of the Mohawk activists who spent months in a stand-off with the country's military over plans to develop a golf course on sacred burial ground. Plus, how an anti-war march turned into a peace camp that endured for nearly 20 years outside an American air base in rural England.</desc>
