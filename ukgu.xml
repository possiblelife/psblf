      <desc lang="en">Following his selection for the GB squad, artistic gymnast Winston is heading off to Germany with his team-mates for an international competition where they will be up against some of the world’s major players. Even though his team are there to support him, he has to face his fear and take on the pommel, the apparatus that has caused him more than his fair share of problems during the last season. The boys also face the distraction of a trip to an out-of-this-world car museum - but will Winston be able to hold it together when the team comes up against some of the world’s best gymnasts from the USA and France. Back in Birmingham, the display girls get to grips with a new routine in preparation for a performance in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games.

First, the teams must guess which animals Sam and Ayo are looking at through their telescope based on a series of clues. Then, there’s a game based on sound and pitch, as Sam and Ayo play a tune using three hidden jars filled with different volumes of water. The teams must then figure out which order the jars go in to make the tune. Finally, the teams bounce around on trampolines to feel like astronauts experiencing low gravity on the moon. They must grab as many space objects hanging above them as they can before the time is up. Meanwhile, the teams have brought a mystery object from Earth. Sam and Ayo try it and test it to figure out what the object is</desc>

He becomes so frustrated that he kicks a beanbag and it hurtles towards the scoreboard, knocking all the points to the ground, ripping the bunting and giving Delivery Duckling, Elder Chick, Elder Panda and the In-Chicks a fright. The crowd is stunned into silence. Love Monster is horrified at what he has done and immediately says sorry. He explains that he wants everyone to cheer for him like they cheer for Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny. She admits it did feel good and tingly inside when everyone was cheering for her, but she says that everyone has something they are good at and Love Monster is the best beatboxer in Fluffytown. Love Monster realises that she is right and starts beatboxing. The Fluffytowners start having fun again and begin cheering for him.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland</title>
      <desc lang="en">Stories of the Troubles from people on all sides of the conflict, beginning by looking at how the situation in Northern Ireland in the late-1960s deteriorated from a time of relative peace. As the civil rights movement gained pace, demanding equal rights for Catholics, the Provisional IRA came to the fore, causing the British Army to be deployed. With the situation compounded by tactical mistakes, soldiers quickly found themselves caught up in violent clashes - leading to 13 unarmed Catholics being shot dead by British paratroopers in Derry on what becomes known as Bloody Sunday</desc>
