Martha applies the scientific calculations she gave to Ollie to help him win Edison, but she still fails to throw a hoop successfully.

For the pumpkin filling: he pours melted butter and buttermilk into a bowl of brown sugar, along with whisked egg, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice and cloves. Febo adds his special ingredient, pumpkin puree, and then mixes them all together. When it's mixed, he spoons it into the empty pastry case and puts it in the oven to cook. Febo's friends all help to decorate his American-themed table before they taste his pumpkin pie.</desc>

Before he goes, he tells Love Monster that soon it will be time for him to go on to his next kiting challenge. Love Monster looks at all the other kites and sees the dragon kite, which is the largest kite of them all. Love Monster’s small kite doesn’t seem that exciting any more. He decides to try the dragon kite for just a minute. At first it seems easy, but then a wind gets it tangled in a tree. The rope breaks, and the kite flies off, causing mayhem in Fluffytown with everyone thinking it is a real dragon invasion. Finally, Elder Panda arrives and manages to bring it down to the ground using an umbrella, and Love Monster comes clean, saying how sorry he is. Elder Panda is disappointed but he does understand, as he too wanted to fly before he could run, but sometimes you have to start small before going big.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Kirstie and Phil catch up with former house-hunters who were looking for a new start. In 2012, Kirsten and Scott moved from Kirkcaldy after Scott was made redundant and secured a new job in Aberdeen. Kirstie managed to find them a rural cottage close to Scott's work. Nine years, several moves and a few job changes later, the pair are back in Kirkcaldy where Kirstie catches up with them. In 2020, Digi had a big budget and even bigger expectations. She was looking for a country pile near London with outbuildings for both her businesses that was close to daughter Emily's school and full of character. Having a medical condition meant her new home also had to be fully accessible. Kirstie rose to the challenge but Digi realised if she wanted to find the perfect property she would have to expand her search. Two years later, Phil visits Digi in her new home in Abingdon to see if she managed to find her dream place</desc>
