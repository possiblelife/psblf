Joining Gail and Keith for this GiggleQuiz are Wizard Tripwick and Captain Adorable. Round 1 features clips starring Gail Force at an archeological dig and the Berrito Brothers testing their muscles with a strength-o-meter. At the end of Round 1, Arthur accidentally drops the Berrito Brother’s massive hammer onto Keith’s buzzer, smashing it into lots of pieces. Always on hand to save the day, Captain Adorable offers to fix the broken buzzer, but after some very unorthodox methods, Keith’s buzzer still isn’t buzzing properly. Round 2 is Nana Knickerbocker’s Panto Showdown, this time featuring Nana’s bees searching for her missing keys that are lost in gloopy, sticky honey. With Round 3 about to begin, Keith decides to take matters into his own hands and attempts to fix the broken buzzer himself. After watching a clip featuring DIY Dan gluing some tiles</desc>

Through interviews with former detectives, forensic investigators, MPs and people who knew Gareth, along with archive footage and reconstruction, this documentary re-examines the case in a bid to get to the bottom of the events that lead to Williams' untimely death - asking did he act alone or were other forces involved?</desc>
