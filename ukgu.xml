Fatigue perhaps played a part in Ebden's defeat, as he and compatriot Max Purcell earlier booked their place in the men's doubles final with a gruelling five-set victory over American Rajeev Ram and home player Joe Salisbury</desc>

Find out how we can help to look after them and our planet, and why and how they grow and survive in different climates. Maddie explores plants in the rainforest, big and small, and sees how the clever drip-tip leaves work watering the plants beneath them. We’ll see how plants in hot, dry parts of world like the desert thrive in their own special ways, like the cactus plant that stores litres of water in its waxy leaves. And we’ll learn how plants that grow close to home in the UK, can grow in a colder and wetter climate.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Paul Murton visits Gigha and Jura, two islands of the Inner Hebrides that are only a few miles apart but could not be more different. He begins at the Achamore Gardens on Gigha, which were created in the 1930s by the malted-drink millionaire James Horlick. He loved Gigha's mild climate so much that he bought the island and made it his home. Today Gigha is owned by the community, and many of its residents are incomers attracted by the opportunity to begin a new island life on this small and fertile place. Where Gigha is small, lush and verdant, Jura is rugged and awe-inspiring. Despite being one of Scotland's largest islands, just 200 people live there - alongside more than 5,000 deer</desc>

This programme explores the issue of expectant mothers who find themselves with no place to call home, and conducts a survey of midwives in collaboration with the Royal College of Midwives to try to get a sense of the scale of the problem. Ninety-five per cent of the midwives asked strongly felt that homelessness puts the health of the women and their unborn babies at risk. The report follows three women - two of whom are heavily pregnant - experiencing evictions, overcrowding and the reality of living in temporary accommodation for years on end</desc>
