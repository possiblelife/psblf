Our 'buy and throw away' culture contributes to the global warming crisis so something has to be done. In a vivid animated world, we learn about the journey that many of our clothes make; from where they are manufactured, all the way to how they are transported to the UK high streets - but are there other alternatives when buying our clothes? Anita sets out to explore sustainable solutions for young people. She talks to environmentalist Zaqiya about her school initiative, Swop it Up, and Holly, manager of the UK's largest charity shop. Together they show us ways young people can buy fashionable clothes and look after the planet at the same time.</desc>

Love Monster looks at all the other kites and sees the dragon kite, which is the largest kite of them all. Love Monster’s small kite doesn’t seem that exciting any more. He decides to try the dragon kite for just a minute. At first it seems easy, but then a wind gets it tangled in a tree. The rope breaks, and the kite flies off, causing mayhem in Fluffytown with everyone thinking it is a real dragon invasion. Finally, Elder Panda arrives and manages to bring it down to the ground using an umbrella, and Love Monster comes clean, saying how sorry he is. Elder Panda is disappointed but he does understand, as he too wanted to fly before he could run, but sometimes you have to start small before going big.</desc>

Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch has built his own rival Grim Academy dome on the side of a large, steep hill. He has uprooted trees in order to make room for his Grimdome, but without the roots of trees to hold the soil together the heavy rainfall starts a mudslide down the side of the hill! Mudslides are very powerful and can destroy anything in their path. Glitch and his cadets need rescuing before they are washed away down the hill</desc>

Finally, the teams must take items from a giant conveyer belt and sort them so they can be reused and recycled. To make it even trickier, the players are attached to bungee cords! In the lab, Sam sits in a bathtub hoping he can come up with a eureka moment of discovery – just like his hero, the ancient Greek scientist Archimedes.</desc>

Nine years, several moves and a few job changes later, the pair are back in Kirkcaldy where Kirstie catches up with them. In 2020, Digi had a big budget and even bigger expectations.

      <desc lang="en">Kirstie and Phil catch up with former house-hunters who were looking for a new start. In 2012, Kirsten and Scott moved from Kirkcaldy after Scott was made redundant and secured a new job in Aberdeen. Kirstie managed to find them a rural cottage close to Scott's work. Nine years, several moves and a few job changes later, the pair are back in Kirkcaldy where Kirstie catches up with them. In 2020, Digi had a big budget and even bigger expectations. She was looking for a country pile near London with outbuildings for both her businesses that was close to daughter Emily's school and full of character. Having a medical condition meant her new home also had to be fully accessible. Kirstie rose to the challenge but Digi realised if she wanted to find the perfect property she would have to expand her search. Two years later, Phil visits Digi in her new home in Abingdon to see if she managed to find her dream place</desc>
