Sebastiaan then carefully makes powder out of his special ingredient, cumin seeds, and adds the powder to the beef mixture. Sebastiaan mixes both the vegetables and the beef in an oven dish and flattens them before adding two bay leaves. He adds a topping of milk and egg and then places it in the oven.

      <desc lang="en">Two teams touch down at the STARS space station to take on three scientific challenges to win out-of-this world prizes. First, they must work out if an object is heavier or lighter than another before placing it on a giant set of scales. Then, there’s a healthy eating quiz based on the food groups that make up a balanced diet. Finally, the teams must take items from a giant conveyer belt and sort them so they can be reused and recycled. To make it even trickier, the players are attached to bungee cords! Meanwhile, Sam and Ayo have installed an update on the supercomputer – but now it won’t do what it’s supposed to do. They must fix the computer by giving it a list of coded instructions</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Once dubbed the 'murder capital' of the world, for nearly three decades, rival gangs ruled the streets of El Salvador through a regime of violence, extortion and fear. That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights. Will Grant meets families impacted by both sides of this controversial policy to uncover the hidden cost of peace on the streets.</desc>
