      <desc lang="en">Zeinab Badawi meets Sir Bryn Terfel, one of the most distinguished singers of our age. A star who is in demand on stages across the world, Bryn has stayed true to his Welsh roots and is a great proponent for Welsh culture. He invites Zeinab behind the scenes not only at the Royal Opera House where he is a regular performer, but also in his native Wales where he still lives and where he is recording an album of traditional folk songs. He was chosen personally by King Charles to sing at his coronation. Zeinab visits the Welsh National Opera which launched Bryn's international career and speaks to WNO general director, Aidan Lang who oversaw his debut performance. The WNO's touring wardrobe manager Judith Russell, shows Zeinab Sir Bryn's costume as Falstaff in the opera by Verdi and explains how she was tasked with dressing him for this iconic role. We meet young Welsh singers performing at the same local singing competitions that Bryn sang in as a young boy and ask how he inspires them t</desc>
