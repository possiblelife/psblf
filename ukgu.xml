    <title lang="en">Death Camp Treblinka: Survivor Stories</title>
      <desc lang="en">An insight into how Samuel Willenberg and Kalman Taigman escaped from the concentration camp in Poland, where more than 800,000 Polish Jews died during the Nazi Holocaust. The two men were able to flee during a revolt in August 1943, before one of them sought vengeance in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising and the other appeared at the trial of Adolf Eichmann for war crimes in 1961. This film documents their stories, the fate of their families and offers fresh accounts of a forgotten death camp</desc>

      <desc lang="en">An insight into the development of forensic science as a way of catching murderers over the past 200 years, charting the scientific breakthroughs that have changed the course of justice. Surgeon and writer Gabriel Weston begins by looking at the difficulty of identifying the body in a murder case, from charred bones to bodies completely dissolved in acid. She focuses on the use of teeth and bite marks to identify a victim or killer, traces the uses of insects to pinpoint the time of death, and meets the geneticist who pioneered the technique of DNA profiling</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Following his selection for the GB squad, artistic gymnast Winston is heading off to Germany with his team-mates for an international competition where they will be up against some of the world’s major players. Even though his team are there to support him, he has to face his fear and take on the pommel, the apparatus that has caused him more than his fair share of problems during the last season. The boys also face the distraction of a trip to an out-of-this-world car museum - but will Winston be able to hold it together when the team comes up against some of the world’s best gymnasts from the USA and France. Back in Birmingham, the display girls get to grips with a new routine in preparation for a performance in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games. Coach Lisa has given the girls a new challenge – not only do they have to perfect their routine, but they also have to choreograph part of it themselves.</desc>

No matter what moves they try, it all goes wrong - balls are dropped, catches are missed, and rules are ignored. In fact, every basketball competition rapidly descends into utter chaos. However, Dad just might have an idea to help give them the edge: a training bootcamp with the London Lions basketball team. Will this be enough for Omari and his younger siblings to snatch victory from Laquarn on the court.</desc>

The teams must then figure out which order the jars go in to make the tune. Finally, the teams must work out which season James is talking about by standing under the correct tree. If they’re right, they’ll get covered in spring blossom, summer sunlight, autumn leaves or winter snow!

The boys are surprised to find an old sheet with a funny picture of a skeleton on it. What could it mean? And who does it belong to? It’s off to the Museum of Cornish Treasures to see if Suzy and Archie have any clues. They reckon it’s something to do with ships and send Fred and Pete off to Charlestown Harbour. There they spot a large ship but are collared by the ship’s captain as they climb on board – not any old ship’s captain, but a pirate captain! Fred and Pete are thrilled to learn that their sheet is, in fact, a pirate flag - a Jolly Roger, used by pirates to warn other ships that they’re on their way to take their goods. After dressing up as pirates, Suzy sends them off to Shipwreck Treasure Museum where museum curator Daniel explains all about pirate treasure like gold and silver coins.

To begin with, Zahra-Rose seasons mashed potato with salt, black pepper, flour, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder and fresh coriander. She then wraps the potato mixture around her special ingredient, hard-boiled eggs, rolls them in breadcrumbs and puts them in the oven to be cooked. Zahra-Rose also serves a fresh chilli sauce, so her friends can use it for dipping. Not only does Zahra-Rose have beautiful decorations, she also has a surprise picnic planned.

That is, until now. For the last year, the country's young, media-savvy president has launched a full-scale war on gangs, imposing emergency constitutional measures and giving police sweeping new powers of arrest. As the State of Exception passes its one-year anniversary, more than 65,000 people have been arrested and dramatic images of a new 'mega prison' hit headlines around the world. But as the country transforms before people's eyes, this newfound freedom hides a dark reality. The government is accused of locking up thousands of innocent people without trial and in flagrant abuse of their human rights.
