      <desc lang="en">David Olusoga explores the house's history from the 1880s to the First World War, a period that saw the property sliding down the social scale and turning from a family home to a multiple occupancy. He discovers how a resident responded to the death of his baby daughter by opening a milk bar for the temperance movement, only to get into legal trouble for watering down his product. David also discovers the story behind a mysterious occupant who lived in the house under a pseudonym and learns how the battle of Passchendaele changed the residents' lives forever</desc>

Round 1 features clips starring Enrico Paso Doble cleaning windows and Keith Fitt trying his hand at karate, only to be bothered by a pesky fly.

Always on hand to save the day, Captain Adorable adorns his Adora-Goggles and attempts to catch the fly in his net. Unfortunately, Captain Adorable mistakes Keith for the fly and chases him around the studio instead! There are more flies in Nana’s Panto Showdown as Nana and her Spiders try to get as many flies as possible stuck in their giant sticky web. At the halfway point, Gail’s team are in the lead with two gigglepoints. Round 3 features a clip starring Gail Force at a campsite. Just as Keith thinks the fly has </desc>

      <desc lang="en">Part one of two. On 26th November 1922, Howard Carter made the greatest archaeological find of all time - the treasure-filled tomb of Egyptian boy king Tutankhamun. An unrivalled discovery made possible by Carter's extraordinary tenacity and the dedicated financier by his side, Lord Carnarvon. But when people who entered the tomb began dying, tales spread of a Pharaoh's Curse. In this first episode, paleo-anthropologist Ella Al-Shamahi begins to unravel the extraordinary scientific truth behind the legend and the press sensation that surrounded it for decades. As she travels from Tut's tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, to a shrine in Wawel cathedral in Krakow, Poland, the investigation links a series of mysterious deaths in both locations, each attributed to a 'curse'. Ella unearths the truly deadly secret lurking in these tombs</desc>
