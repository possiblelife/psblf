She then cycles off before telling him what a sipping host does. Love Monster goes to Elder Panda to ask his advice, and he tells him there are many ways to serve hot chocolate - each person needs to find their own unique way. Elder Panda adds honey and banana from his garden to his. Love Monster starts the ceremony by adding his signature marshmallows, but then Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny announces she puts marshmallows in hers too. Love Monster thinks he needs to use something more unusual, so he adds pickles, but this doesn't go down well - in fact, it tastes horrible! It turns out the reason why he was chosen was so that he could make hot chocolate the way he always makes it. He does, and everyone loves it.</desc>

The What’s in the Box? game reveals a wooden birthday cake, and when the toddlers and parents open up a bigger box, they discover lots more objects and toys that are inspired by a birthday party theme. This subject is explored through play, song and story. Grown-ups are encouraged to take part at home by hiding a safe, toddler-appropriate birthday party toy or object inside a recycled box for them to reveal and explore with their toddler! Storytime is all about fun and playful discovery, as the Toddler Twins’ friend Koala throws a surprise birthday party for Panda! Viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring the birthday party theme too. And, The Big Band Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with stretching and the Goodbye song.</desc>

Even the usually fiery Chloe Brockett reaches out to Junaid, which leaves Ella worried that this might affect her new friendship group - meanwhile, it's all change for Saff. After recently turning 30, she decides that it's time to finally leave the family home and move into a place of her own - she enlists the help of her friends to declutter and realises that she is holding on to more than just material things, but how will her dad take the news of her moving out, and where will Saff move to? Diags is struggling to adjust to his life as manager at Plumb Point - luckily, Dan and Gatsby are on hand with support, and suggest he practices his interview and management skills. Will Diags show the boys he is management material, or will he crack under the pressure?</desc>
