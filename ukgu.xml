      <desc lang="en">In honour of the Women’s World Cup, legendary Lioness Jill Scott is joined by Rattus for a journey through the history of the beautiful game. Although football as we know it is a relatively recent invention, it’s been around in some form or other for much longer than you think. Ball games have been played for centuries, and that’s why the manager of struggling Ratchester Utd is scouring history to find players who can help him avoid relegation in Historical All or Nothing. Elsewhere, a Roman legion is struggling to survive the ancient game of harpastum, a ball game that was meant to encourage team spirit, but seemingly actually encouraged death and dismemberment! Women’s football is flourishing around the world right now, but did you know that the FA once banned it for more than 70 years? We meet some of the women’s game’s early pioneers, and also their pet jaguars!

We explore a laboratory where they do experiments, the food they eat, how they wash and even how they go to the toilet. We find out that the space station is made from thousands of parts that were put together by astronauts in space, and we learn that it’s also a home because it’s a place where astronauts eat, sleep and have fun.</desc>

But what exactly is hurling? Even these two can’t miss hurling expert Mayor Paul in his full regalia. Paul explains how hurling is a game played by Town and Country teams in St Columb Major, where the silver ball is thrown and ‘hurled’ between team members, but the pitch consists of the entire town and the goals are miles apart! Fred and Pete soon run out of puff trying to play on their own, but Suzy points them back to the playing fields where the mayor and some children are about to play a game.

We learn how robots are sent on special missions to Mars and how they take pictures and send information back to Earth.

Dr Laura Ryan, of Macquarie University, explains her research into a possible case of mistaken identity in which the sharks are mistaking humans for their preferred prey of seals.</desc>
