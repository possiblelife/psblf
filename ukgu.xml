Poor Tina has a hook stuck in her mouth and is too weak to swim. After Peso tends to her wound, the Octonauts agree to help get her to the tuna spawning grounds. But they’ll have to be quick: egg-laying season doesn’t last long. Luckily, Tweak’s latest gup, the Gup-R, is the fastest she’s ever built! The Octonauts use it to tow Tina, but when the Gup-R’s battery dies, how will they catch up to the rest of her school?</desc>

The crowd is stunned into silence. Love Monster is horrified at what he has done and immediately says sorry. He explains that he wants everyone to cheer for him like they cheer for Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny. She admits it did feel good and tingly inside when everyone was cheering for her, but she says that everyone has something they are good at and Love Monster is the best beatboxer in Fluffytown. Love Monster realises that she is right and starts beatboxing. The Fluffytowners start having fun again and begin cheering for him.</desc>
