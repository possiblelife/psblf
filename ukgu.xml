Unfortunately, the spread of this remarkable plant is leading to the destruction of the rainforests, particularly in Borneo and Sumatra. So what can we do?

      <desc lang="en">The OZT brothers pack their binoculars to explore the natural world right on our doorstep, meeting some of the surprising urban wild animals that can be found in our towns and cities. Tyler finds himself holding onto a cliff edge in Bristol to find out why the fastest bird on earth, the peregrine falcon, is quickly becoming the top bird in town. Aaron heads to Devon to reveal how the water vole is being brought back from the brink of extinction. He also lends a helping hand at a wildlife rescue centre as they give two hedgehog patients a new home Back at OZT HQ, bird expert Nadeem pits the brothers against each other to find out which of them is the ultimate bird brain. Cam demonstrates how clever camouflage can help capture incredible wildlife shots similar to those from Sir David Attenborough’s Wild Isles. Meanwhile, Aaron is joined at OZT HQ by the brown rat,one of Britain’s most successful and adaptable animals, and reveals rat facts galore - but are they all Fact or Fake?</desc>

With the help of the Teeny Tiny Creatures poem, we discover that, like lots of other teeny tiny creatures, red squirrels are superheroes and help our planet in their own special way. In the Teeny Tiny Task, Rory shows Sandy what it might feel like to be a red squirrel as he jumps around in the treetops.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">When holidays go right they offer much-needed rest and relaxation in the lap of luxury. However, those same vacations can just as easily end in disaster. Examples include chartered accountant Bill and his wife Tanya, who spent £11,000 on a once-in-a-lifetime cruise to the Bahamas, only to end up trapped in the eye of a huge storm. Iain and Judie's luxury dream trip to Vegas turned into deadly nightmare when they were caught up in the now infamous shootings in October 2017 in which 58 people were killed. Contributors include Danni Menzies, Scarlette Douglas and Simon Calder. Narrated by Glynis Barber</desc>
